<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Silvio Pellico</span> was born at Saluzzo,
in North Italy, in the year of the fall of the Bastille,
1789.&nbsp; His health as a child was feeble, his temper gentle,
and he had the instincts of a poet.&nbsp; Before he was ten years
old he had written a tragedy on a theme taken from
Macpherson&rsquo;s Ossian.&nbsp; His chief delight as a boy was
in acting plays with other children, and he acquired from his
father a strong interest in the patriotic movements of the
time.&nbsp; He fastened upon French literature during a stay of
some years at Lyons with a relation of his mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Ugo Foscolo&rsquo;s <i>Sepolcri</i> revived his patriotism, and
in 1810, at the age of twenty-one, he returned to Italy.&nbsp; He
taught French in the Soldiers&rsquo; Orphans&rsquo; School at
Milan.&nbsp; At Milan he was admitted to the friendship of
Vincenzo Monti, a poet then touching his sixtieth year, and of
the younger Ugo Foscolo, by whose writings he had been powerfully
stirred, and to whom he became closely bound.&nbsp; Silvio
Pellico wrote in classical form a tragedy, <i>Laodicea</i>, and
then, following the national or romantic school, for a famous
actress of that time, another tragedy, <i>Francesca di
Rimini</i>, which was received with great applause.</p>
<p>After the dissolution of the kingdom of Italy, in April 1814,
Pellico became tutor to the two children of the Count Porro
Lambertenghi, at whose table he met writers of mark, from many
countries; Byron (whose <i>Manfred</i> he translated), Madame de
Stael, Schlegel, Manzoni, and others.&nbsp; In 1819 Silvio
Pellico began publishing <i>Il Conciliatore</i>, a journal purely
literary, that was to look through literature to the life that it
expresses, and so help towards the better future of his
country.&nbsp; But the merciless excisions of inoffensive
passages by the Austrian censorship destroyed the journal in a
year.</p>
<p>A secret political association had been formed in Italy of men
of all ranks who called themselves the Carbonari (charcoal
burners), and who sought the reform of government in Italy.&nbsp;
In 1814 they had planned a revolution in Naples, but there was no
action until 1820.&nbsp; After successful pressure on the King of
the two Sicilies, the forces of the Carbonari under General Pepe
entered Naples on the ninth of July, 1820, and King Ferdinand I.
swore on the 13th of July to observe the constitution which the
Carbonari had proclaimed at Nola and elsewhere during the
preceding month.&nbsp; On the twenty-fifth of August, the
Austrian government decreed death to every member of a secret
society, and <i>carcere duro e durissimo</i>, severest pains of
imprisonment, to all who had neglected to oppose the progress of
Carbonarism.&nbsp; Many seizures were made, and on the 13th of
October the gentle editor of the <i>Conciliatore</i>, Silvio
Pellico, was arrested as a friend of the Carbonari, and taken to
the prison of Santa Margherita in Milan.</p>
<p>In the same month of October, the Emperors of Austria and
Russia, and the Prince of Prussia met at Troppau to concert
measures for crushing the Carbonari.</p>
<p>In January, 1821, they met Ferdinand I. at Laybach and then
took arms against Naples.&nbsp; Naples capitulated on the 20th of
March, and on the 24th of March, 1821, its Revolutionary council
was closed.&nbsp; A decree of April 10th condemned to death all
persons who attended meetings of the Carbonari, and the result
was a great accession to the strength of this secret society,
which spread its branches over Germany and France.</p>
<p>On the 19th of February, 1821, Silvio Pellico was transferred
to imprisonment under the leads, on the isle of San Michele,
Venice.&nbsp; There he wrote two plays, and some poems.&nbsp; On
the 21st of February, 1822, he and his friend Maroncelli were
condemned to death; but, their sentence being commuted to twenty
years for Maroncelli, and fifteen years for Pellico, of
<i>carcere duro</i>, they entered their underground prisons at
Spielberg on the 10th of April, 1822.&nbsp; The government
refused to transmit Pellico&rsquo;s tragedies to his family,
lest, though harmless in themselves, the acting of them should
bring good-will to a state prisoner.&nbsp; At Spielberg he
composed a third tragedy, <i>Leoniero da Dordona</i>, though
deprived of books, paper, and pens, and preserved it in his
memory.&nbsp; In 1828, a rumour of Pellico&rsquo;s death in
prison caused great excitement throughout Italy.&nbsp; On the
17th of September, 1830, he was released, by the amnesty of that
year, and, avoiding politics thenceforth, devoted himself to
religion.&nbsp; The Marchesa Baroli, at Turin, provided for his
maintenance, by engaging him as her secretary and
librarian.&nbsp; With health made weaker by his sufferings,
Silvio Pellico lived on to the age of sixty-five, much honoured
by his countrymen.&nbsp; Gioberti dedicated a book to him as
&ldquo;The first of Italian Patriots.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died at
Turin on the 1st of February, 1854.</p>
<p>Silvio Pellico&rsquo;s account of his imprisonment, <i>Le Mie
Prigioni</i>, was first published in Paris in 1833.&nbsp; It has
been translated into many languages, and is the work by which he
will retain his place in European literature.&nbsp; His other
plays, besides the two first named, were <i>Eufemia di
Messina</i>; <i>Iginia di Asti</i>; <i>Leoniero da Dordona</i>,
already named as having been thought out at Spielberg; his
<i>Gismonda</i>; <i>l&rsquo;Erodiade</i>; <i>Ester
d&rsquo;Engaddi</i>; <i>Corradino</i>; and a play upon Sir Thomas
More.&nbsp; He wrote also poems, <i>Cantiche</i>, of which the
best are <i>Eligi e Valfrido</i> and <i>Egilde</i>; and, in his
last years, a religious manual on the <i>Duties of Men</i>.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> I penned these memorials, let
me ask myself, from any paltry vanity, or desire to talk about
that self?&nbsp; I hope this is not the case, and forasmuch as
one may be able to judge in one&rsquo;s own cause, I think I was
actuated by better views.&nbsp; These, briefly, were to afford
consolation to some unfortunate being, situated like myself, by
explaining the evils to which I was exposed, and those sources of
relief which I found were accessible, even when labouring under
the heaviest misfortune; to bear witness, moreover, that in the
midst of my acute and protracted torments, I never found
humanity, in the human instruments around me, so hopelessly
wicked, so unworthy of consideration, or so barren of noble minds
in lowly station, as it is customary to represent it; to engage,
if possible, all the generous and good-hearted to love and esteem
each other, to become incapable of hating any one; to feel
irreconcilable hatred only towards low, base falsehood;
cowardice, perfidy, and every kind of moral degradation.&nbsp; It
is my object to impress on all that well-known but too often
forgotten truth, namely, that both religion and philosophy
require calmness of judgment combined with energy of will, and
that without such a union, there can be no real justice, no
dignity of character, and no sound principles of human
action.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Friday, the 15th of October,
1820, I was arrested at Milan, and conveyed to the prison of
Santa Margherita.&nbsp; The hour was three in the
afternoon.&nbsp; I underwent a long examination, which occupied
the whole of that and several subsequent days; but of this I
shall say nothing.&nbsp; Like some unfortunate lover, harshly
dealt with by her he adored, yet resolved to bear it with
dignified silence, I leave <i>la Politica</i>, such as <span
class="GutSmall">SHE IS</span>, and proceed to something
else.</p>
<p>At nine in the evening of that same unlucky Friday, the
actuary consigned me to the jailer, who conducted me to my
appointed residence.&nbsp; He there politely requested me to give
up my watch, my money, and everything in my pockets, which were
to be restored to me in due time; saying which he respectfully
bade me good-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, my dear sir,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;I have not
yet dined; let me have something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Directly; the inn is close by, and you will find the
wine good, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wine I do not drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this announcement Signor Angiolino gave me a look of
unfeigned surprise; he imagined that I was jesting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Masters of prisons,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;who keep
shop, have a natural horror of an abstemious captive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be; I don&rsquo;t drink it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for you, sir; you will feel solitude twice
as heavily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But perceiving that I was firm, he took his leave; and in half
an hour I had something to eat.&nbsp; I took a mouthful,
swallowed a glass of water, and found myself alone.&nbsp; My
chamber was on the ground floor, and overlooked the
court-yard.&nbsp; Dungeons here, dungeons there, to the right, to
the left, above, below, and opposite, everywhere met my
eye.&nbsp; I leaned against the window, listened to the passing
and repassing of the jailers, and the wild song of a number of
the unhappy inmates.&nbsp; A century ago, I reflected, and this
was a monastery; little then thought the pious, penitent recluses
that their cells would now re-echo only to the sounds of
blasphemy and licentious song, instead of holy hymn and
lamentation from woman&rsquo;s lips; that it would become a
dwelling for the wicked of every class&mdash;the most part
destined to perpetual labour or to the gallows.&nbsp; And in one
century to come, what living being will be found in these
cells?&nbsp; Oh, mighty Time! unceasing mutability of
things!&nbsp; Can he who rightly views your power have reason for
regret or despair when Fortune withdraws her smile, when he is
made captive, or the scaffold presents itself to his eye?
yesterday I thought myself one of the happiest of men; to-day
every pleasure, the least flower that strewed my path, has
disappeared.&nbsp; Liberty, social converse, the face of my
fellow-man, nay, hope itself hath fled.&nbsp; I feel it would be
folly to flatter myself; I shall not go hence, except to be
thrown into still more horrible receptacles of sorrow; perhaps,
bound, into the hands of the executioner.&nbsp; Well, well, the
day after my death it will be all one as if I had yielded my
spirit in a palace, and been conveyed to the tomb, accompanied
with all the pageantry of empty honours.</p>
<p>It was thus, by reflecting on the sweeping speed of time, that
I bore up against passing misfortune.&nbsp; Alas, this did not
prevent the forms of my father, my mother, two brothers, two
sisters, and one other family I had learned to love as if it were
my own, from all whom I was, doubtless, for ever cut off, from
crossing my mind, and rendering all my philosophical reasoning of
no avail.&nbsp; I was unable to resist the thought, and I wept
even as a child.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> months previous to this time
I had gone to Turin, where, after several years of separation, I
saw my parents, one of my brothers, and two sisters.&nbsp; We had
always been an attached family; no son had ever been more deeply
indebted to a father and a mother than I; I remember I was
affected at beholding a greater alteration in their looks, the
progress of age, than I had expected.&nbsp; I indulged a secret
wish to part from them no more, and soothe the pillow of
departing age by the grateful cares of a beloved son.&nbsp; How
it vexed me, too, I remember, during the few brief days I passed
with them, to be compelled by other duties to spend so much of
the day from home, and the society of those I had such reason to
love and to revere; yes, and I remember now what my mother said
one day, with an expression of sorrow, as I went
out&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! our Silvio has not come to Turin to see
<i>us</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; The morning of my departure for Milan was
a truly painful one.&nbsp; My poor father accompanied me about a
mile on my way; and, on leaving me, I more than once turned to
look at him, and, weeping, kissed the ring my mother had just
given me; nor did I ever before quit my family with a feeling of
such painful presentiment.&nbsp; I am not superstitious; but I
was astonished at my own weakness, and I more than once exclaimed
in a tone of terror, &ldquo;Good God! whence comes this strange
anxiety and alarm?&rdquo; and, with a sort of inward vision, my
mind seemed to behold the approach of some great calamity.&nbsp;
Even yet in prison I retain the impression of that sudden dread
and parting anguish, and can recall each word and every look of
my distressed parents.&nbsp; The tender reproach of my mother,
&ldquo;Ah! Silvio has not come to Turin to see <i>us</i>!&rdquo;
seemed to hang like a weight upon my soul.&nbsp; I regretted a
thousand instances in which I might have shown myself more
grateful and agreeable to them; I did not even tell them how much
I loved; all that I owed to them.&nbsp; I was never to see them
more, and yet I turned my eyes with so much like indifference
from their dear and venerable features!&nbsp; Why, why was I so
chary of giving expression to what I felt (would they could have
read it in my looks), to all my gratitude and love?&nbsp; In
utter solitude, thoughts like these pierced me to the soul.</p>
<p>I rose, shut the window, and sat some hours, in the idea that
it would be in vain to seek repose.&nbsp; At length I threw
myself on my pallet, and excessive weariness brought me
sleep.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> awake the first night in a
prison is a horrible thing.&nbsp; Is it possible, I murmured,
trying to collect my thoughts, is it possible I am here?&nbsp; Is
not all that passed a dream?&nbsp; Did they really seize me
yesterday?&nbsp; Was it I whom they examined from morning till
night, who am doomed to the same process day after day, and who
wept so bitterly last night when I thought of my dear
parents?&nbsp; Slumber, the unbroken silence, and rest had, in
restoring my mental powers, added incalculably to the capability
of reflecting, and, consequently, of grief.&nbsp; There was
nothing to distract my attention; my fancy grew busy with absent
forms, and pictured, to my eye the pain and terror of my father
and mother, and of all dear to me, on first hearing the tidings
of my arrest.</p>
<p>At this moment, said I, they are sleeping in peace; or
perhaps, anxiety for me may keep them watching, yet little
anticipating the fate to which I am here consigned.&nbsp; Happy
for them, were it the will of God, that they should cease to
exist ere they hear of this horrible misfortune.&nbsp; Who will
give them strength to bear it?&nbsp; Some inward voice seemed to
whisper me, He whom the afflicted look up to, love and
acknowledge in their hearts; who enabled a mother to follow her
son to the mount of Golgotha, and to stand under His cross.&nbsp;
He, the friend of the unhappy, the friend of man.</p>
<p>Strange this should be the first time I truly felt the power
of religion in my heart; and to filial love did I owe this
consolation.&nbsp; Though not ill-disposed, I had hitherto been
little impressed with its truth, and had not well adhered to
it.&nbsp; All common-place objections I estimated at their just
value, yet there were many doubts and sophisms which had shaken
my faith.&nbsp; It was long, indeed, since they had ceased to
trouble my belief in the existence of the Deity; and persuaded of
this, it followed necessarily, as part of His eternal justice,
that there must be another life for man who suffers so unjustly
here.&nbsp; Hence, I argued, the sovereign reason in man for
aspiring to the possession of that second life; and hence, too, a
worship founded on the love of God, and of his neighbour, and an
unceasing impulse to dignify his nature by generous
sacrifices.&nbsp; I had already made myself familiar with this
doctrine, and I now repeated, &ldquo;And what else is
Christianity but this constant ambition to elevate and dignify
our nature?&rdquo; and I was astonished, when I reflected how
pure, how philosophical, and how invulnerable the essence of
Christianity manifested itself, that there could come an epoch
when philosophy dared to assert, &ldquo;From this time forth I
will stand instead of a religion like this.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in
what manner&mdash;by inculcating vice?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp;
By teaching virtue?&nbsp; Why that will be to teach us to love
God and our neighbour; and that is precisely what Christianity
has already done, on far higher and purer motives.&nbsp; Yet,
notwithstanding such had, for years, been my opinion, I had
failed to draw the conclusion, Then be a Christian!&nbsp; No
longer let corruption and abuses, the work of man, deter you; no
longer make stumbling-blocks of little points of doctrine, since
the principal point, made thus irresistibly clear, is to love God
and your neighbour.</p>
<p>In prison I finally determined to admit this conclusion, and I
admitted it.&nbsp; The fear, indeed, of appearing to others more
religious than I had before been, and to yield more to misfortune
than to conviction, made me sometimes hesitate; but feeling that
I had done no wrong, I felt no debasement, and cared nothing to
encounter the possible reproaches I had not deserved, resolving
henceforward to declare myself openly a Christian.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">adhered</span> firmly to this resolution
as time advanced; but the consideration of it was begun the first
night of my captivity.&nbsp; Towards morning the excess of my
grief had grown calmer, and I was even astonished at the
change.&nbsp; On recalling the idea of my parents and others whom
I loved, I ceased to despair of their strength of mind, and the
recollection of those virtues which I knew they had long
possessed gave me real consolation.&nbsp; Why had I before felt
such great dismay on thinking of them, and now so much confidence
in their strength of mind?&nbsp; Was this happy change
miraculous, or the natural effect of my renewed belief in
God?&nbsp; What avails the distinction, while the genuine sublime
benefits of religion remain the same.</p>
<p>At midnight two <i>secondini</i> (the under jailers are so
termed) had paid me a visit, and found me in a very ill mood; in
the morning they returned, and were surprised to see me so calm,
and even cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night, sir, you had the face of a basilisk,&rdquo;
said Tirola; &ldquo;now you are quite another thing; I rejoice at
it, if, indeed, it be a sign, forgive me the expression, that you
are not a scoundrel.&nbsp; Your scoundrels (for I am an old hand
at the trade, and my observations are worth something) are always
more enraged the second day after their arrest than the
first.&nbsp; Do you want some snuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not take it, but will not refuse your offer.&nbsp;
If I have not a gorgon-face this morning, it must surely be a
proof of my utter insensibility, or easy belief of soon regaining
my freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should doubt that, even though you were not in
durance for state matters.&nbsp; At this time of day they are not
so easily got over as you might think; you are not so raw as to
imagine such a thing.&nbsp; Pardon me, but you will know more by
and by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, how come you to have so pleasant a look,
living only, as you do, among the unfortunate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, you will attribute it to indifference to
others&rsquo; sufferings; of a truth, I know not how it is; yet,
I assure you, it often gives me pain to see the prisoners
weep.&nbsp; Truly, I sometimes pretend to be merry to bring a
smile upon their faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thought has just struck me, my friend, which I never
had before; it is, that a jailer may be made of very congenial
clay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the trade has nothing to do with that, sir.&nbsp;
Beyond that huge vault you see there, without the court-yard, is
another court, and other prisons, all prepared for women.&nbsp;
They are, sir, women of a certain class; yet are there some
angels among them, as to a good heart.&nbsp; And if you were in
my place, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; and I laughed out heartily.</p>
<p>Tirola was quite disconcerted, and said no more.&nbsp; Perhaps
he meant to imply that had I been a <i>secondino</i>, it would
have been difficult not to become attached to some one or other
of these unfortunates.</p>
<p>He now inquired what I wished to take for breakfast, left me,
and soon returned with my coffee.&nbsp; I looked hard at him,
with a sort of malicious smile, as much as to say, &ldquo;Would
you carry me a bit of a note to an unhappy friend&mdash;to my
friend Piero?&rdquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a>&nbsp; He understood it, and answered
with another: &ldquo;No sir; and if you do not take heed how you
ask any of my comrades, they will betray you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether or not we understood each other, it is certain I was
ten times upon the point of asking him for a sheet of paper,
&amp;c.; but there was a something in his eye which seemed to
warn me not to confide in any one about me, and still less to
others than himself.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Had</span> Tirola, with his expression of
good-nature, possessed a less roguish look, had there been
something a little more dignified in his aspect, I should have
tried to make him my ambassador; for perhaps a brief
communication, if in time, might prevent my friend committing
some fatal error, perhaps save him, poor fellow; besides several
others, including myself: and too much was already known.&nbsp;
Patience! it was fated to be thus.</p>
<p>I was here recalled to be examined anew.&nbsp; The process
continued through the day, and was again and again repeated,
allowing me only a brief interval during dinner.&nbsp; While this
lasted, the time seemed to pass rapidly; the excitement of mind
produced by the endless series of questions put to me, and by
going over them at dinner and at night, digesting all that had
been asked and replied to, reflecting on what was likely to come,
kept me in a state of incessant activity.&nbsp; At the end of the
first week I had to endure a most vexatious affair.&nbsp; My poor
friend Piero, eager as myself to have some communication, sent me
a note, not by one of the jailers, but by an unfortunate prisoner
who assisted them.&nbsp; He was an old man from sixty to seventy,
and condemned to I know not how long a period of captivity.&nbsp;
With a pin I had by me I pricked my finger, and scrawled with my
blood a few lines in reply, which I committed to the same
messenger.&nbsp; He was unluckily suspected, caught with the note
upon him, and from the horrible cries that were soon heard, I
conjectured that he was severely bastinadoed.&nbsp; At all events
I never saw him more.</p>
<p>On my next examination I was greatly irritated to see my note
presented to me (luckily containing nothing but a simple
salutation), traced in my blood.&nbsp; I was asked how I had
contrived to draw the blood; was next deprived of my pin, and a
great laugh was raised at the idea and detection of the
attempt.&nbsp; Ah, I did not laugh, for the image of the poor old
messenger rose before my eyes.&nbsp; I would gladly have
undergone any punishment to spare the old man.&nbsp; I could not
repress my tears when those piercing cries fell upon my
ear.&nbsp; Vainly did I inquire of the jailers respecting his
fate.&nbsp; They shook their heads, observing, &ldquo;He has paid
dearly for it, he will never do such like things again; he has a
little more rest now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor would they speak more
fully.&nbsp; Most probably they spoke thus on account of his
having died under, or in consequence of, the punishment he had
suffered; yet one day I thought I caught a glimpse of him at the
further end of the court-yard, carrying a bundle of wood on his
shoulders.&nbsp; I felt a beating of the heart as if I had
suddenly recognised a brother.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I ceased to be persecuted with
examinations, and had no longer anything to fill up my time, I
felt bitterly the increasing weight of solitude.&nbsp; I had
permission to retain a bible, and my Dante; the governor also
placed his library at my disposal, consisting of some romances of
Scuderi, Piazzi, and worse books still; but my mind was too
deeply agitated to apply to any kind of reading whatever.&nbsp;
Every day, indeed, I committed a canto of Dante to memory, an
exercise so merely mechanical, that I thought more of my own
affairs than the lines during their acquisition.&nbsp; The same
sort of abstraction attended my perusal of other things, except,
occasionally, a few passages of scripture.&nbsp; I had always
felt attached to this divine production, even when I had not
believed myself one of its avowed followers.&nbsp; I now studied
it with far greater respect than before; yet my mind was often
almost involuntarily bent upon other matters; and I knew not what
I read.&nbsp; By degrees I surmounted this difficulty, and was
able to reflect upon its great truths with higher relish than I
had ever before done.&nbsp; This, in me, did not give rise to the
least tendency to moroseness or superstition, nothing being more
apt than misdirected devotion to weaken and distort the
mind.&nbsp; With the love of God and mankind, it inspired me also
with a veneration for justice, and an abhorrence of wickedness,
along with a desire of pardoning the wicked.&nbsp; Christianity,
instead of militating against anything good, which I had derived
from Philosophy, strengthened it by the aid of logical
deductions, at once more powerful and profound.</p>
<p>Reading one day that it was necessary to pray without ceasing,
and that prayer did not consist in many words uttered after the
manner of the Pharisees, but in making every word and action
accord with the will of God, I determined to commence with
earnestness, to pray in the spirit with unceasing effort: in
other words, to permit no one thought which should not be
inspired by a wish to conform my whole life to the decrees of
God.</p>
<p>The forms I adopted were simple and few; not from contempt of
them (I think them very salutary, and calculated to excite
attention), but from the circumstance of my being unable to go
through them at length, without becoming so far abstracted as to
make me forget the solemn duty in which I am engaged.&nbsp; This
habitual observance of prayer, and the reflection that God is
omnipresent as well as omnipotent in His power to save, began ere
long to deprive solitude of its horrors, and I often repeated,
&ldquo;Have I not the best society man can have?&rdquo; and from
this period I grew more cheerful, I even sang and whistled in the
new joy of my heart.&nbsp; And why lament my captivity?&nbsp;
Might not a sudden fever have carried me off? and would my
friends then have grieved less over my fate than now? and cannot
God sustain them even as He could under a more trying
dispensation?&nbsp; And often did I offer up my prayers and
fervent hopes that my dear parents might feel, as I myself felt,
resigned to my lot; but tears frequently mingled with sweet
recollections of home.&nbsp; With all this, my faith in God
remained undisturbed, and I was not disappointed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> live at liberty is doubtless
much better than living in a prison; but, even here, the
reflection that God is present with us, that worldly joys are
brief and fleeting, and that true happiness is to be sought in
the conscience, not in external objects, can give a real zest to
life.&nbsp; In less than one month I had made up my mind, I will
not say perfectly, but in a tolerable degree, as to the part I
should adopt.&nbsp; I saw that, being incapable of the mean
action of obtaining impunity by procuring the destruction of
others, the only prospect that lay before me was the scaffold, or
long protracted captivity.&nbsp; It was necessary that I should
prepare myself.&nbsp; I will live, I said to myself, so long as I
shall be permitted, and when they take my life, I will do as the
unfortunate have done before me; when arrived at the last moment,
I can die.&nbsp; I endeavoured, as much as possible, not to
complain, and to obtain every possible enjoyment of mind within
my reach.&nbsp; The most customary was that of recalling the many
advantages which had thrown a charm round my previous life; the
best of fathers, of mothers, excellent brothers and sisters, many
friends, a good education, and a taste for letters.&nbsp; Should
I now refuse to be grateful to God for all these benefits,
because He had pleased to visit me with misfortune?&nbsp;
Sometimes, indeed, in recalling past scenes to mind, I was
affected even to tears; but I soon recovered my courage and
cheerfulness of heart.</p>
<p>At the commencement of my captivity I was fortunate enough to
meet with a friend.&nbsp; It was neither the governor, nor any of
his under-jailers, nor any of the lords of the
process-chamber.&nbsp; Who then?&mdash;a poor deaf and dumb boy,
five or six years old, the offspring of thieves, who had paid the
penalty of the law.&nbsp; This wretched little orphan was
supported by the police, with several other boys in the same
condition of life.&nbsp; They all dwelt in a room opposite my
own, and were only permitted to go out at certain hours to
breathe a little air in the yard.&nbsp; Little deaf and dumb used
to come under my window, smiled, and made his obeisance to
me.&nbsp; I threw him a piece of bread; he took it, and gave a
leap of joy, then ran to his companions, divided it, and returned
to eat his own share under the window.&nbsp; The others gave me a
wistful look from a distance, but ventured no nearer, while the
deaf and dumb boy expressed a sympathy for me; not, I found,
affected, out of mere selfishness.&nbsp; Sometimes he was at a
loss what to do with the bread I gave him, and made signs that he
had eaten enough, as also his companions.&nbsp; When he saw one
of the under-jailers going into my room, he would give him what
he had got from me, in order to restore it to me.&nbsp; Yet he
continued to haunt my window, and seemed rejoiced whenever I
deigned to notice him.&nbsp; One day the jailer permitted him to
enter my prison, when he instantly ran to embrace my knees,
actually uttering a cry of joy.&nbsp; I took him up in my arms,
and he threw his little hands about my neck, and lavished on me
the tenderest caresses.&nbsp; How much affection in his smile and
manner! how eagerly I longed to have him to educate, raise him
from his abject condition, and snatch him, perhaps, from utter
ruin.&nbsp; I never even learnt his name; he did not himself know
that he had one.&nbsp; He seemed always happy, and I never saw
him weep except once, and that was on being beaten, I know not
why, by the jailer.&nbsp; Strange that he should be thus happy in
a receptacle of so much pain and sorrow; yet he was light-hearted
as the son of a grandee.&nbsp; From him I learnt, at least, that
the mind need not depend on situation, but may be rendered
independent of external things.&nbsp; Govern the imagination, and
we shall be well, wheresoever we happen to be placed.&nbsp; A day
is soon over, and if at night we can retire to rest without
actual pain and hunger, it little matters whether it be within
the walls of a prison, or of a kind of building which they call a
palace.&nbsp; Good reasoning this; but how are we to contrive so
to govern the imagination?&nbsp; I began to try, and sometimes I
thought I had succeeded to a miracle; but at others the
enchantress triumphed, and I was unexpectedly astonished to find
tears starting into my eyes.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> so far fortunate, I often
said, that they have given me a dungeon on the ground floor, near
the court, where that dear boy comes within a few steps of me, to
converse in our own mute language.&nbsp; We made immense progress
in it; we expressed a thousand various feelings I had no idea we
could do, by the natural expressions of the eye, the gesture, and
the whole countenance.&nbsp; Wonderful human intelligence!&nbsp;
How graceful were his motions! how beautiful his smile! how
quickly he corrected whatever expression I saw of his that seemed
to displease me!&nbsp; How well he understands I love him, when
he plays with any of his companions!&nbsp; Standing only at my
window to observe him, it seemed as if I possessed a kind of
influence over his mind, favourable to his education.&nbsp; By
dint of repeating the mutual exercise of signs, we should be
enabled to perfect the communication of our ideas.&nbsp; The more
instruction he gets, the more gentle and kind he becomes, the
more he will be attached to me.&nbsp; To him I shall be the
genius of reason and of good; he will learn to confide his
sorrows to me, his pleasures, all he feels and wishes; I will
console, elevate, and direct him in his whole conduct.&nbsp; It
may be that this my lot may be protracted from month to month,
even till I grow grey in my captivity.&nbsp; Perhaps this little
child may continue to grow under my eye, and become one in the
service of this large family of pain, and grief, and
calamity.&nbsp; With such a disposition as he has already shown,
what would become of him?&nbsp; Alas; he would at most be made
only a good under-keeper, or fill some similar place.&nbsp; Yet I
shall surely have conferred on him some benefit if I can succeed
in giving him a desire to do kind offices to the good and to
himself, and to nourish sentiments of habitual benevolence.&nbsp;
This soliloquy was very natural in my situation; I was always
fond of children, and the office of an instructor appeared to me
a sublime duty.&nbsp; For a few years I had acted in that
capacity with Giacomo and Giulio Porro, two young men of noble
promise, whom I loved, and shall continue to love as if they were
my own sons.&nbsp; Often while in prison were my thoughts busied
with them; and how it grieved me not to be enabled to complete
their education.&nbsp; I sincerely prayed that they might meet
with a new master, who would be as much attached to them as I had
been.</p>
<p>At times I could not help exclaiming to myself, What a strange
burlesque is all this! instead of two noble youths, rich in all
that nature and fortune can endow them with, here I have a pupil,
poor little fellow! deaf, dumb, a castaway; the son of a robber,
who at most can aspire only to the rank of an under-jailer, and
which, in a little less softened phraseology, would mean to say a
<i>sbirro</i>. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a>&nbsp; This reflection confused and
disquieted me; yet hardly did I hear the <i>strillo</i> <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> of my little dummy than I felt my heart
grow warm again, just as a father when he hears the voice of a
son.&nbsp; I lost all anxiety about his mean estate.&nbsp; It is
no fault of his if he be lopped of Nature&rsquo;s fairest
proportions, and was born the son of a robber.&nbsp; A humane,
generous heart, in an age of innocence, is always
respectable.&nbsp; I looked on him, therefore, from day to day
with increased affection, and was more than ever desirous of
cultivating his good qualities, and his growing
intelligence.&nbsp; Nay, perhaps we might both live to get out of
prison, when I would establish him in the college for the deaf
and dumb, and thus open for him a path more fortunate and
pleasing than to play the part of a <i>shirro</i>.&nbsp; Whilst
thus pleasingly engaged in meditating his future welfare, two of
the under-jailers one day walked into my cell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must change your quarters, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mean you by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have orders to remove you into another
chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some other great bird has been caged, and this being
the better apartment&mdash;you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! it is the first resting-place for the newly
arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They conveyed me to the opposite side of the court, where I
could no longer converse with my little deaf and dumb friend, and
was far removed from the ground floor.&nbsp; In walking across, I
beheld the poor boy sitting on the ground, overcome with grief
and astonishment, for he knew he had lost me.&nbsp; Ere I quite
disappeared, he ran towards me; my conductors tried to drive him
away, but he reached me, and I caught him in my arms, and
returned his caresses with expressions of tenderness I sought not
to conceal.&nbsp; I tore myself from him, and entered my new
abode.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a dark and gloomy place;
instead of glass it had pasteboard for the windows; the walls
were rendered more repulsive by being hung with some wretched
attempts at painting, and when free from this lugubrious colour,
were covered with inscriptions.&nbsp; These last gave the name
and country of many an unhappy inmate, with the date of the fatal
day of their captivity.&nbsp; Some consisted of lamentations on
the perfidy of false friends, denouncing their own folly, or
women, or the judge who condemned them.&nbsp; Among a few were
brief sketches of the victims&rsquo; lives; still fewer embraced
moral maxims.&nbsp; I found the following words of Pascal:
&ldquo;Let those who attack religion learn first what religion
is.&nbsp; Could it boast of commanding a direct view of the
Deity, without veil or mystery, it would be to attack that
religion to say, &lsquo;that there is nothing seen in the world
which displays Him with such clear evidence.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
since it rather asserts that man is involved in darkness, far
from God, who is hidden from human knowledge, insomuch as to give
Himself the name in scripture of &lsquo;<i>Deus
absconditus</i>,&rsquo; what advantage can the enemies of
religion derive when, neglecting, as they profess to do, the
science of truth, they complain that the truth is not made
apparent to them?&rdquo;&nbsp; Lower down was written (the words
of the same author), &ldquo;It is not here a question of some
trivial interest relating to a stranger; it applies to ourselves,
and to all we possess.&nbsp; The immortality of the soul is a
question of that deep and momentous importance to all, as to
imply an utter loss of reason to rest totally indifferent as to
the truth or the fallacy of the proposition.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another
inscription was to this effect: &ldquo;I bless the hour of my
imprisonment; it has taught me to know the ingratitude of man, my
own frailty, and the goodness of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Close to these
words again appeared the proud and desperate imprecations of one
who signed himself an Atheist, and who launched his impieties
against the Deity, as if he had forgotten that he had just before
said there was no God.&nbsp; Then followed another column,
reviling the cowardly fools, as they were termed, whom captivity
had converted into fanatics.&nbsp; I one day pointed out these
strange impieties to one of the jailers, and inquired who had
written them?&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad I have found this,&rdquo;
was the reply, &ldquo;there are so many of them, and I have so
little time to look for them;&rdquo; and he took his knife, and
began to erase it as fast as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you do that?&rdquo; I inquired of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the poor devil who wrote it was condemned to
death for a cold-blooded murder; he repented, and made us promise
to do him this kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven pardon him!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;what was
it he did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as he found he could not kill his enemy, he
revenged himself by slaying the man&rsquo;s son, one of the
finest boys you ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was horror-struck.&nbsp; Could ferocity of disposition
proceed to such lengths? and could a monster, capable of such a
deed, hold the insulting language of a man superior to all human
weaknesses? to murder the innocent, and a child!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my new prison, black and filthy
to an extreme, I sadly missed the society of my little dumb
friend.&nbsp; I stood for hours in anxious, weary mood, at the
window which looked over a gallery, on the other side of which
could be seen the extremity of the court-yard, and the window of
my former cell.&nbsp; Who had succeeded me there?&nbsp; I could
discern his figure, as he paced quickly to and fro, apparently in
violent agitation.&nbsp; Two or three days subsequently, I
perceived that he had got writing materials, and remained busied
at his little table the whole of the day.&nbsp; At length I
recognised him.&nbsp; He came forth accompanied by his jailer; he
was going to be examined, when I saw he was no other than
Melchiorre Gioja. <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a>&nbsp; It went to my heart: &ldquo;You,
too, noble, excellent man, have not escaped!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet he
was more fortunate than I.&nbsp; After a few months&rsquo;
captivity, he regained his liberty.&nbsp; To behold any really
estimable being always does me good; it affords me pleasant
matter for reflection, and for esteem&mdash;both of great
advantage.&nbsp; I could have laid down my life to save such a
man from captivity; yet merely to see him was some consolation to
me.&nbsp; After regarding him intently, some time, to ascertain
if he were tranquil or agitated, I offered up a heart-felt prayer
for his deliverance; I felt my spirits revived, a greater flow of
ideas, and greater satisfaction with myself.&nbsp; Such an
incident as this has a charm for utter solitude, of which you can
form no idea without experiencing it.&nbsp; A poor dumb boy had
before supplied me with this real enjoyment, and I now derived it
from a distant view of a man of distinguished merit.</p>
<p>Perhaps some one of the jailers had informed him where I
was.&nbsp; One morning, on opening his window, he waved his
handkerchief in token of salutation, and I replied in the same
manner.&nbsp; I need not describe the pleasure I felt; it
appeared as if we were no longer separated; and we discoursed in
the silent intercourse of the spirit, which, when every other
medium is cut off, in the least look, gesture, or signal of any
kind, can make itself comprehended and felt.</p>
<p>It was with no small pleasure I anticipated a continuation of
this friendly communication.&nbsp; Day after day, however, went
on, and I was never more gratified by the appearance of the same
favourite signals.&nbsp; Yet I frequently saw my friend at his
window; I waved my handkerchief, but in vain; he answered it no
more.&nbsp; I was now informed by our jailers, that Gioja had
been strictly prohibited from exciting my notice, or replying to
it in any manner.&nbsp; Notwithstanding, he still continued to
look at me, and I at him, and in this way, we conversed upon a
great variety of subjects, which helped to keep us alive.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Along</span> the same gallery, upon a
level with my prison, I saw other prisoners passing and repassing
the whole day to the place of examination.&nbsp; They were, for
the chief part, of lowly condition, but occasionally one or two
of better rank.&nbsp; All, however, attracted my attention, brief
as was the sight of them, and I truly compassionated them.&nbsp;
So sorrowful a spectacle for some time filled me with grief, but
by degrees I became habituated to it, and at last it rather
relieved than added to the horror of my solitude.&nbsp; A number
of women, also, who had been arrested, passed by.&nbsp; There was
a way from the gallery, through a large vault, leading to another
court, and in that part were placed the female prisoners, and
others labouring under disease.&nbsp; A single wall, and very
slight, separated my dwelling from that of some of the
women.&nbsp; Sometimes I was almost deafened with their songs, at
others with their bursts of maddened mirth.&nbsp; Late at
evening, when the din of day had ceased, I could hear them
conversing, and, had I wished, I could easily have joined with
them.&nbsp; Was it timidity, pride, or prudence which restrained
me from all communication with the unfortunate and degraded of
their sex?&nbsp; Perhaps it partook of all.&nbsp; Woman, when she
is what she ought to be, is for me a creature so admirable, so
sublime, the mere seeing, hearing, and speaking to her, enriches
my mind with such noble fantasies; but rendered vile and
despicable, she disturbs, she afflicts, she deprives my heart, as
it were, of all its poetry and its love.&nbsp; Spite of this,
there were among those feminine voices, some so very sweet that,
there is no use in denying it, they were dear to me.&nbsp; One in
particular surpassed the rest; I heard it more seldom, and it
uttered nothing unworthy of its fascinating tone.&nbsp; She sung
little and mostly kept repeating these two pathetic
lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Chi rende alla meschina<br />
La sua felicit&agrave;?</p>
<p>Ah, who will give the lost one<br />
Her vanished dream of bliss?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At other times, she would sing from the litany.&nbsp; Her
companions joined with her; but still I could discern the voice
of Maddalene from all others, which seemed only to unite for the
purpose of robbing me of it.&nbsp; Sometimes, too, when her
companions were recounting to her their various misfortunes, I
could hear her pitying them; could catch even her very sighs,
while she invariably strove to console them: &ldquo;Courage,
courage, my poor dear,&rdquo; she one day said, &ldquo;God is
very good, and He will not abandon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How could I do otherwise than imagine she was beautiful, more
unfortunate than guilty, naturally virtuous, and capable of
reformation?&nbsp; Who would blame me because I was affected with
what she said, listened to her with respect, and offered up my
prayers for her with more than usual earnestness of heart.&nbsp;
Innocence is sacred, and repentance ought to be equally
respected.&nbsp; Did the most perfect of men, the Divinity on
earth, refuse to cast a pitying eye on weak, sinful women; to
respect their fear and confusion, and rank them among the minds
he delighted to consort with and to honour?&nbsp; By what law,
then, do we act, when we treat with so much contempt women fallen
into ignominy?</p>
<p>While thus reasoning, I was frequently tempted to raise my
voice and speak, as a brother in misfortune, to poor
Maddalene.&nbsp; I had often even got out the first syllable; and
how strange!&nbsp; I felt my heart beat like an enamoured youth
of fifteen; I who had reached thirty-one; and it seemed as if I
should never be able to pronounce the name, till I cried out
almost in a rage, &ldquo;Mad!&nbsp; Mad!&rdquo; yes, mad enough,
thought I.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> ended my romance with that
poor unhappy one; yet it did not fail to produce me many sweet
sensations during several weeks.&nbsp; Often, when steeped in
melancholy, would her sweet calm voice breathe consolation to my
spirit; when, dwelling on the meanness and ingratitude of
mankind, I became irritated, and hated the world, the voice of
Maddalene gently led me back to feelings of compassion and
indulgence.</p>
<p>How I wish, poor, unknown, kind-hearted repentant one, that no
heavy punishment may befall thee.&nbsp; And whatever thou shalt
suffer, may it well avail thee, re-dignify thy nature, and teach
thee to live and die to thy Saviour and thy Lord.&nbsp; Mayest
thou meet compassion and respect from all around thee, as thou
didst from me a stranger to thee.&nbsp; Mayest thou teach all who
see thee thy gentle lesson of patience, sweetness, the love of
virtue, and faith in God, with which thou didst inspire him who
loved without having beheld thee.&nbsp; Perhaps I erred in
thinking thee beautiful, but, sure I am, thou didst wear the
beauty of the soul.&nbsp; Thy conversation, though spoken amidst
grossness and corruption of every kind, was ever chaste and
graceful; whilst others imprecated, thou didst bless; when eager
in contention, thy sweet voice still pacified, like oil upon the
troubled waters.&nbsp; If any noble mind hath read thy worth, and
snatched thee from an evil career; hath assisted thee with
delicacy, and wiped the tears from thy eyes, may every reward
heaven can give be his portion, that of his children, and of his
children&rsquo;s children!</p>
<p>Next to mine was another prison occupied by several men.&nbsp;
I also heard <i>their</i> conversation.&nbsp; One seemed of
superior authority, not so much probably from any difference of
rank, as owing to greater eloquence and boldness.&nbsp; He
played, what may musically be termed, the first fiddle.&nbsp; He
stormed himself, yet put to silence those who presumed to quarrel
by his imperious voice.&nbsp; He dictated the tone of the
society, and after some feeble efforts to throw off his authority
they submitted, and gave the reins into his hands.</p>
<p>There was not a single one of those unhappy men who had a
touch of that in him to soften the harshness of prison hours, to
express one kindly sentiment, one emanation of religion, or of
love.&nbsp; The chief of these neighbours of mine saluted me, and
I replied.&nbsp; He asked me how I contrived to pass such a
cursed dull life?&nbsp; I answered, that it was melancholy, to be
sure; but no life was a cursed one to me, and that to our last
hour, it was best to do all to procure oneself the pleasure of
thinking and of loving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain, sir, explain what you mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I explained, but was not understood.&nbsp; After many
ingenious attempts, I determined to clear it up in the form of
example, and had the courage to bring forward the extremely
singular and moving effect produced upon me by the voice of
Maddalene; when the magisterial head of the prison burst into a
violent fit of laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is all that, what is
that?&rdquo; cried his companions.&nbsp; He then repeated my
words with an air of burlesque; peals of laughter followed, and I
there stood, in their eyes, the picture of a convicted
blockhead.</p>
<p>As it is in prison, so it is in the world.&nbsp; Those who
make it their wisdom to go into passions, to complain, to defy,
to abuse, think that to pity, to love, to console yourself with
gentle and beautiful thoughts and images, in accord with humanity
and its great Author, is all mere folly.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">let</span> them laugh and said not a
word; they hit at me again two or three times, but I was
mute.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will come no more near the window,&rdquo;
said one, &ldquo;he will hear nothing but the sighs of Maddalene;
we have offended him with laughing.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length, the
chief imposed silence upon the whole party, all amusing
themselves at my expense.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silence, beasts as you
are; devil a bit you know what you are talking about.&nbsp; Our
neighbour is none so long eared an animal as you imagine.&nbsp;
You do not possess the power of reflection, no not you.&nbsp; I
grin and joke; but afterwards I reflect.&nbsp; Every low-born
clown can stamp and roar, as we do here.&nbsp; Grant a little
more real cheerfulness, a spark more of charity, a bit more faith
in the blessing of heaven;&mdash;what do you imagine that all
this would be a sign of?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, that I also
reflect,&rdquo; replied one, &ldquo;I fancy it would be a sign of
being a little less of a brute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried his leader, in a most stentorian
howl! &ldquo;now I begin to have some hope of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not overproud at being thus rated a <i>little less of a
brute</i> than the rest; yet I felt a sort of pleasure that these
wretched men had come to some agreement as to the importance of
cultivating, in some degree, more benevolent sentiments.</p>
<p>I again approached the window, the chief called me, and I
answered, hoping that I might now moralise with him in my own
way.&nbsp; I was deceived; vulgar minds dislike serious
reasoning; if some noble truth start up, they applaud for a
moment, but the next withdraw their notice, or scruple not to
attempt to shine by questioning, or aiming to place it in some
ludicrous point of view.</p>
<p>I was next asked if I were imprisoned for debt?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are paying the penalty of a false oath,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is quite a different thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An affair of love, most likely, I guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have killed a man, mayhap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for carbonarism, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are these carbonari?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know so little of them, I cannot tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here a jailer interrupted us in great anger; and after
commenting on the gross improprieties committed by my neighbours,
he turned towards me, not with the gravity of a <i>sbirro</i>,
but the air of a master: &ldquo;For shame, sir, for shame! to
think of talking to men of this stamp! do you know, sir, that
they are all robbers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reddened up, and then more deeply for having shown I
blushed, and methought that to deign to converse with the unhappy
of however lowly rank, was rather a mark of goodness than a
fault.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning I went to my window to
look for Melchiorre Gioja; but conversed no more with the
robbers.&nbsp; I replied to their salutation, and added, that I
had been forbidden to hold conversation.&nbsp; The secretary who
had presided at my examinations, told me with an air of mystery,
I was about to receive a visit.&nbsp; After a little further
preparation, he acquainted me that it was my father; and so
saying, bade me follow him.&nbsp; I did so, in a state of great
agitation, assuming at the same time an appearance of perfect
calmness in order not to distress my unhappy parent.&nbsp; Upon
first hearing of my arrest, he had been led to suppose it was for
some trifling affair, and that I should soon be set at
liberty.&nbsp; Finding his mistake, however, he had now come to
solicit the Austrian government on my account.&nbsp; Here, too,
he deluded himself, for he never imagined I could have been rash
enough to expose myself to the penalty of the laws, and the
cheerful tone in which I now spoke persuaded him that there was
nothing very serious in the business.</p>
<p>The few words that were permitted to pass between us gave me
indescribable pain; the more so from the restraint I had placed
upon my feelings.&nbsp; It was yet more difficult at the moment
of parting.&nbsp; In the existing state of things, as regarded
Italy, I felt convinced that Austria would make some fearful
examples, and that I should be condemned either to death or long
protracted imprisonment.&nbsp; It was my object to conceal this
from my father and to flatter his hopes at a moment when I was
inquiring for a mother, brother, and sisters, whom I never
expected to behold more.&nbsp; Though I knew it to be impossible,
I even calmly requested of him that he would come and see me
again, while my heart was wrung with the bitter conflict of my
feelings.&nbsp; He took his leave, filled with the same agreeable
delusion, and I painfully retraced my steps back into my
dungeon.&nbsp; I thought that solitude would now be a relief to
me; that to weep would somewhat ease my burdened heart? yet,
strange to say, I could not shed a tear.&nbsp; The extreme
wretchedness of feeling this inability even to shed tears
excites, under some of the heaviest calamities, is the severest
trial of all, and I have often experienced it.</p>
<p>An acute fever, attended by severe pains in my head, followed
this interview.&nbsp; I could not take any nourishment; and I
often said, how happy it would be for me, were it indeed to prove
mortal.&nbsp; Foolish and cowardly wish! heaven refused to hear
my prayer, and I now feel grateful that it did.&nbsp; Though a
stern teacher, adversity fortifies the mind, and renders man what
he seems to have been intended for; at least, a good man, a being
capable of struggling with difficulty and danger; presenting an
object not unworthy, even in the eyes of the old Romans, of the
approbation of the gods.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days afterwards I again saw my
father.&nbsp; I had rested well the previous night, and was free
from fever; before him I preserved the same calm and even
cheerful deportment, so that no one could have suspected I had
recently suffered, and still continued to suffer so much.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am in hopes,&rdquo; observed my father, &ldquo;that
within a very few days we shall see you at Turin.&nbsp; Your
mother has got your old room in readiness, and we are all
expecting you to come.&nbsp; Pressing affairs now call me away,
but lose no time, I entreat you, in preparing to rejoin us once
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; His kind and affecting expressions added to my
grief.&nbsp; Compassion and filial piety, not unmingled with a
species of remorse, induced me to feign assent; yet afterwards I
reflected how much more worthy it had been, both of my father and
myself, to have frankly told him that most probably, we should
never see each other again, at least in this world.&nbsp; Let us
take farewell like men, without a murmur and without a tear, and
let me receive the benediction of a father before I die.&nbsp; As
regarded myself, I should wish to have adopted language like
that; but when I gazed on his aged and venerable features, and
his grey hairs, something seemed to whisper me, that it would be
too much for the affectionate old man to bear; and the words died
in my heart.&nbsp; Good God! I thought, should he know the extent
of the <i>evil</i>, he might, perhaps, run distracted, such is
his extreme attachment to me: he might fall at my feet, or even
expire before my eyes.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I could not tell him the
truth, nor so much as prepare him for it; we shed not a tear, and
he took his departure in the same pleasing delusion as
before.&nbsp; On returning into my dungeon I was seized in the
same manner, and with still more aggravated suffering, as I had
been after the last interview; and, as then, my anguish found no
relief from tears.</p>
<p>I had nothing now to do but resign myself to all the horrors
of long captivity, and to the sentence of death.&nbsp; But to
prepare myself to bear the idea of the immense load of grief that
must fall on every dear member of my family, on learning my lot,
was beyond my power.&nbsp; It haunted me like a spirit, and to
fly from it I threw myself on my knees, and in a passion of
devotion uttered aloud the following prayer:&mdash;&ldquo;My God!
from thy hand I will accept all&mdash;for me all: but deign most
wonderfully to strengthen the hearts of those to whom I was so
very dear!&nbsp; Grant thou that I may cease to be such to them
now; and that not the life of the least of them may be shortened
by their care for me, even by a single day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange! wonderful power of prayer! for several hours my mind
was raised to a contemplation of the Deity, and my confidence in
His goodness proportionately increased; I meditated also on the
dignity of the human mind when, freed from selfishness, it exerts
itself to will only that which is the will of eternal
wisdom.&nbsp; This can be done, and it is man&rsquo;s duty to do
it.&nbsp; Reason, which is the voice of the Deity, teaches us
that it is right to submit to every sacrifice for the sake of
virtue.&nbsp; And how could the sacrifice which we owe to virtue
be completed, if in the most trying afflictions we struggle
against the will of Him who is the source of all virtue?&nbsp;
When death on the scaffold, or any other species of martyrdom
becomes inevitable, it is a proof of wretched degradation, or
ignorance, not to be able to approach it with blessing upon our
lips.&nbsp; Nor is it only necessary we should submit to death,
but to the affliction which we know those most dear to us must
suffer on our account.&nbsp; All it is lawful for us to ask is,
that God will temper such affliction, and that he will direct us
all, for such a prayer is always sure to be accepted.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a period of some days I
continued in the same state of mind; a sort of calm sorrow, full
of peace, affection, and religious thoughts.&nbsp; I seemed to
have overcome every weakness, and as if I were no longer capable
of suffering new anxiety.&nbsp; Fond delusion! it is man&rsquo;s
duty to aim at reaching as near to perfection as possible, though
he can never attain it here.&nbsp; What now disturbed me was the
sight of an unhappy friend, my good Piero, who passed along the
gallery within a few yards of me, while I stood at my
window.&nbsp; They were removing him from his cell into the
prison destined for criminals.&nbsp; He was hurried by so swiftly
that I had barely time to recognise him, and to receive and
return his salutation.</p>
<p>Poor young man! in the flower of his age, with a genius of
high promise, of frank, upright, and most affectionate
disposition, born with a keen zest of the pleasures of existence,
to be at once precipitated into a dungeon, without the remotest
hope of escaping the severest penalty of the laws.&nbsp; So great
was my compassion for him, and my regret at being unable to
afford him the slightest consolation, that it was long before I
could recover my composure of mind.&nbsp; I knew how tenderly he
was attached to every member of his numerous family, how deeply
interested in promoting their happiness, and how devotedly his
affection was returned.&nbsp; I was sensible what must be the
affliction of each and all under so heavy a calamity.&nbsp;
Strange, that though I had just reconciled myself to the idea in
my own case, a sort of phrensy seized my mind when I depicted the
scene; and it continued so long that I began to despair of
mastering it.</p>
<p>Dreadful as this was, it was still but an illusion.&nbsp; Ye
afflicted ones, who believe yourselves victims of some
irresistible, heart-rending, and increasing grief, suffer a
little while with patience, and you will be undeceived.&nbsp;
Neither perfect peace, nor utter wretchedness can be of long
continuance here below.&nbsp; Recollect this truth, that you may
not become unduly elevated in prosperity, and despicable under
the trials which assuredly await you.&nbsp; A sense of weariness
and apathy succeeded the terrible excitement I had
undergone.&nbsp; But indifference itself is transitory, and I had
some fear lest I should continue to suffer without relief under
these wretched extremes of feeling.&nbsp; Terrified at the
prospect of such a future, I had recourse once more to the only
Being from whom I could hope to receive strength to bear it, and
devoutly bent down in prayer.&nbsp; I beseeched the Father of
mercies to befriend my poor deserted Piero, even as myself, and
to support his family no less than my own.&nbsp; By constant
repetition of prayers like these, I became perfectly calm and
resigned.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was then I reflected upon my
previous violence; I was angry at my own weakness and folly, and
sought means of remedying them.&nbsp; I had recourse to the
following expedient.&nbsp; Every morning, after I had finished my
devotions, I set myself diligently to work to recall to mind
every possible occurrence of a trying and painful kind, such as a
final parting from my dearest friends and the approach of the
executioner.&nbsp; I did this not only in order to inure my
nerves to bear sudden or dreadful incidents, too surely my future
portion, but that I might not again be taken unawares.&nbsp; At
first this melancholy task was insupportable, but I persevered;
and in a short time became reconciled to it.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1821 Count Luigi Porro <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> obtained permission to see me.&nbsp; Our
warm friendship, the eagerness to communicate our mutual
feelings, and the restraint imposed by the presence of an
imperial secretary, with the brief time allowed us, the
presentiments I indulged, and our efforts to appear calm, all led
me to expect that I should be thrown into a state of fearful
excitement, worse than I had yet suffered.&nbsp; It was not so;
after taking his leave I remained calm; such to me proved the
signal efficacy of guarding against the assault of sudden and
violent emotions.&nbsp; The task I set myself to acquire,
constant calmness of mind, arose less from a desire to relieve my
unhappiness than from a persuasion how undignified, unworthy, and
injurious, was a temper opposite to this, I mean a continued
state of excitement and anxiety.&nbsp; An excited mind ceases to
reason; carried away by a resistless torrent of wild ideas, it
forms for itself a sort of mad logic, full of anger and
malignity; it is in a state at once as absolutely unphilosophical
as it is unchristian.</p>
<p>If I were a divine I should often insist upon the necessity of
correcting irritability and inquietude of character; none can be
truly good without that be effected.&nbsp; How nobly pacific,
both with regard to himself and others, was He whom we are all
bound to imitate.&nbsp; There is no elevation of mind, no justice
without moderation in principles and ideas, without a pervading
spirit which inclines us rather to smile at, than fall into a
passion with, the events of this little life.&nbsp; Anger is
never productive of any good, except in the extremely rare case
of being employed to humble the wicked, and to terrify them from
pursuing the path of crime, even as the usurers were driven by an
angry Saviour, from polluting his holy Temple.&nbsp; Violence and
excitement, perhaps, differing altogether from what I felt, are
no less blamable.&nbsp; Mine was the mania of despair and
affliction: I felt a disposition, while suffering under its
horrors, to hate and to curse mankind.&nbsp; Several individuals,
in particular, appeared to my imagination depicted in the most
revolting colours.&nbsp; It is a sort of moral epidemic, I
believe, springing from vanity and selfishness; for when a man
despises and detests his fellow-creatures, he necessarily assumes
that he is much better than the rest of the world.&nbsp; The
doctrine of such men amounts to this:&mdash;&ldquo;Let us admire
only one another, if we turn the rest of mankind into a mere mob,
we shall appear like demi-gods on earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a
curious fact that living in a state of hostility and rage
actually affords pleasure; it seems as if people thought there
was a species of heroism in it.&nbsp; If, unfortunately, the
object of our wrath happens to die, we lose no time in finding
some one to fill the vacant place.&nbsp; Whom shall I attack
next, whom shall I hate?&nbsp; Ah! is that the villain I was
looking out for?&nbsp; What a prize!&nbsp; Now my friends, at
him, give him no quarter.&nbsp; Such is the world, and, without
uttering a libel, I may add that it is not what it ought to
be.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> showed no great malignity,
however, to complain of the horrible place in which they had
incarcerated me, but fortunately another room became vacant, and
I was agreeably surprised on being informed that I was to have
it.&nbsp; Yet strangely enough, I reflected with regret that I
was about to leave the vicinity of Maddalene.&nbsp; Instead of
feeling rejoiced, I mourned over it with almost childish
feeling.&nbsp; I had always attached myself to some object, even
from motives comparatively slight.&nbsp; On leaving my horrible
abode, I cast back a glance at the heavy wall against which I had
so often supported myself, while listening as closely as possible
to the gentle voice of the repentant girl.&nbsp; I felt a desire
to hear, if only for the last time, those two pathetic
lines,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Chi rende alla meschina<br />
La sua felicit&agrave;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vain hope! here was another separation in the short period of
my unfortunate life.&nbsp; But I will not go into any further
details, lest the world should laugh at me, though it would be
hypocrisy in me to affect to conceal that, for several days
after, I felt melancholy at this imaginary parting.</p>
<p>While going out of my dungeon I also made a farewell signal to
two of the robbers, who had been my neighbours, and who were then
standing at their window.&nbsp; Their chief also got notice of my
departure, ran to the window, and repeatedly saluted me.&nbsp; He
began likewise to sing the little air, <i>Chi rende alla
meschina</i>; and was this, thought I, merely to ridicule
me?&nbsp; No doubt that forty out of fifty would say decidedly,
&ldquo;It was!&rdquo;&nbsp; In spite, however, of being outvoted,
I incline to the opinion that the <i>good robber</i> meant it
kindly; and, as such I received it, and gave him a look of
thanks.&nbsp; He saw it, and thrust his arm through the bars, and
waved his cap, nodding kindly to me as I turned to go down the
stairs.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the yard below, I was further consoled by a
sight of the little deaf and dumb boy.&nbsp; He saw me, and
instantly ran towards me with a look of unfeigned delight.&nbsp;
The wife of the jailer, however, Heaven knows why, caught hold of
the little fellow, and rudely thrusting him back, drove him into
the house.&nbsp; I was really vexed; and yet the resolute little
efforts he made even then to reach me, gave me indescribable
pleasure at the moment, so pleasing it is to find that one is
really loved.&nbsp; This was a day full of great adventures for
<i>me</i>; a few steps further I passed the window of my old
prison, now the abode of Gioja: &ldquo;How are you,
Melchiorre?&rdquo; I exclaimed as I went by.&nbsp; He raised his
head, and getting as near me as it was <i>possible</i>, cried
out, &ldquo;How do you do, Silvio?&rdquo;&nbsp; They would not
let me stop a single moment; I passed through the great gate,
ascended a flight of stairs, which brought us to a large,
well-swept room, exactly over that occupied by Gioja.&nbsp; My
bed was brought after me, and I was then left to myself by my
conductors.&nbsp; My first object was to examine the walls; I met
with several inscriptions, some written with charcoal, others in
pencil, and a few incised with some sharp point.&nbsp; I remember
there were some very pleasing verses in French, and I am sorry I
forgot to commit them to mind.&nbsp; They were signed &ldquo;The
duke of Normandy.&rdquo;&nbsp; I tried to sing them, adapting to
them, as well as I could, the favourite air of my poor
Maddalene.&nbsp; What was my surprise to hear a voice, close to
me, reply in the same words, sung to another air.&nbsp; When he
had finished, I cried out, &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; and he saluted me
with great respect, inquiring if I were a Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; an Italian, and my name is Silvio
Pellico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The author of <i>Francesca da Rimini</i>?&rdquo; <a
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he made me a fine compliment, following it with the
condolences usual on such occasions, upon hearing I had been
committed to prison.&nbsp; He then inquired of what part of Italy
I was a native.&nbsp; &ldquo;Piedmont,&rdquo; was the reply;
&ldquo;I am from Saluzzo.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here I was treated to
another compliment, on the character and genius of the
Piedmontese, in particular, the celebrated men of Saluzzo, at the
head of whom he ranked Bodoni. <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; All this was
said in an easy refined tone, which showed the man of the world,
and one who had received a good education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, may I be permitted,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to
inquire who you are, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you singing one of my little songs,&rdquo; was
the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! the two beautiful stanzas upon the wall are
yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are, therefore,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The unfortunate duke of Normandy.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> jailer at that moment passed
under our windows, and ordered us to be silent.</p>
<p>What can he mean by the unfortunate duke of Normandy? thought
I, musing to myself.&nbsp; Ah! is not that the title said to be
assumed by the son of Louis XVI.? but that unhappy child is
indisputably no more.&nbsp; Then my neighbour must be one of
those unlucky adventurers who have undertaken to bring him to
life again.&nbsp; Not a few had already taken upon themselves to
personate this Louis XVII., and were proved to be impostors; how
is my new acquaintance entitled to greater credit for his
pains?</p>
<p>Although I tried to give him the advantage of a doubt, I felt
an insurmountable incredulity upon the subject, which was not
subsequently removed.&nbsp; At the same time, I determined not to
mortify the unhappy man, whatever sort of absurdity he might
please to hazard before my face.</p>
<p>A few minutes afterwards he began again to sing, and we soon
renewed our conversation.&nbsp; In answer to my inquiry,
&ldquo;What is your real name?&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am no
other than Louis XVII.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he then launched into
very severe invectives against his uncle, Louis XVIII., the
usurper of his just and natural rights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;did you not prefer your
claims at the period of the restoration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was unable, from extreme illness, to quit the city of
Bologna.&nbsp; The moment I was better I hastened to Paris; I
presented myself to the allied monarchs, but the work was
done.&nbsp; The good Prince of Cond&eacute; knew, and received me
with open arms, but his friendship availed me not.&nbsp; One
evening, passing through a lonely street, I was suddenly attacked
by assassins, and escaped with difficulty.&nbsp; After wandering
through Normandy, I returned into Italy, and stopped some time at
Modena.&nbsp; Thence I wrote to the allied powers, in particular
to the Emperor Alexander, who replied to my letter with
expressions of the greatest kindness.&nbsp; I did not then
despair of obtaining justice, or, at all events, if my rights
were to be sacrificed, of being allowed a decent provision,
becoming a prince.&nbsp; But I was arrested, and handed over to
the Austrian government.&nbsp; During eight months I have been
here buried alive, and God knows when I shall regain my
freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I begged him to give me a brief sketch of his life.&nbsp; He
told me very minutely what I already knew relating to Louis XVII.
and the cruel Simon, and of the infamous calumnies that wretch
was induced to utter respecting the unfortunate queen,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Finally he said, that while in prison, some persons
came with an idiot boy of the name of Mathurin, who was
substituted for him, while he himself was carried off.&nbsp; A
coach and four was in readiness; one of the horses was merely a
wooden-machine, in the interior of which he was concealed.&nbsp;
Fortunately, they reached the confines, and the General (he gave
me the name, which has escaped me) who effected his release,
educated him for some time with the attention of a father, and
subsequently sent, or accompanied him, to America.&nbsp; There
the young king, without a sceptre, had room to indulge his
wandering disposition; he was half famished in the forests;
became at length a soldier, and resided some time, in good
credit, at the court of the Brazils.&nbsp; There, too, he was
pursued and persecuted, till compelled to make his escape.&nbsp;
He returned to Europe towards the close of Napoleon&rsquo;s
career, was kept a close prisoner at Naples by Murat; and, at
last, when he was liberated, and in full preparation to reclaim
the throne of France, he was seized with that unlucky illness at
Bologna, during which Louis XVIII. was permitted to assume his
nephew&rsquo;s crown.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> this he related with an air of
remarkable frankness and truth.&nbsp; Although not justified in
believing him, I nevertheless was astonished at his knowledge of
the most minute facts connected with the revolution.&nbsp; He
spoke with much natural fluency, and his conversation abounded
with a variety of curious anecdotes.&nbsp; There was something
also of the soldier in his expression, without showing any want
of that sort of elegance resulting from an intercourse with the
best society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it be permitted me,&rdquo; I inquired, &ldquo;to
converse with you on equal terms, without making use of any
titles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I myself wish you to do,&rdquo; was the
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have at least reaped one advantage from
adversity; I have learnt to smile at all these vanities.&nbsp; I
assure you that I value myself more upon being a man, than having
been born a prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were in the habit of conversing together both night and
morning, for a considerable time; and, in spite of what I
considered the comic part of his character, he appeared to be of
a good disposition, frank, affable, and interested in the virtue
and happiness of mankind.&nbsp; More than once I was on the point
of saying, &ldquo;Pardon me; I wish I could believe you were
Louis XVII., but I frankly confess I cannot prevail on myself to
believe it; be equally sincere, I entreat you, and renounce this
singular fiction of yours.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had even prepared to
introduce the subject with an edifying discourse upon the vanity
of all imposture, even of such untruths as may appear in
themselves harmless.</p>
<p>I put off my purpose from day to day; I partly expected that
we should grow still more friendly and confidential, but I had
never the heart really to try the experiment upon his
feelings.&nbsp; When I reflect upon this want of resolution, I
sometimes attempt to reconcile myself to it on the ground of
proper urbanity, unwillingness to give offence, and other reasons
of the kind.&nbsp; Still these excuses are far from satisfying
me; I cannot disguise that I ought not to have permitted my
dislike to preaching him a sermon to stand in the way of speaking
my real sentiments.&nbsp; To affect to give credit to imposture
of any kind is miserable weakness, such as I think I should not,
even in similar circumstances, exhibit again.&nbsp; At the same
time, it must be confessed that, preface it as you will, it is a
harsh thing to say to any one, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
you!&rdquo;&nbsp; He will naturally resent it; it would deprive
us of his friendship or regard: nay it would, perhaps, make him
hate us.&nbsp; Yet it is better to run every risk than to
sanction an untruth.&nbsp; Possibly, the man capable of it, upon
finding that his imposture is known, will himself admire our
sincerity, and afterwards be induced to reflect in a manner that
may produce the best results.</p>
<p>The under-jailers were unanimously of opinion that he was
really Louis XVII., and having already seen so many strange
changes of fortune, they were not without hopes that he would
some day ascend the throne of France, and remember the good
treatment and attentions he had met with.&nbsp; With the
exception of assisting in his escape, they made it their object
to comply with all his wishes.&nbsp; It was by such means I had
the honour of forming an acquaintance with this grand
personage.&nbsp; He was of the middle height, between forty and
forty-five years of age, rather inclined to corpulency, and had
features strikingly like those of the Bourbons.&nbsp; It is very
probable that this accidental resemblance may have led him to
assume the character he did, and play so melancholy a part in
it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is one other instance of
unworthy deference to private opinion, of which I must accuse
myself.&nbsp; My neighbour was not an Atheist, he rather liked to
converse on religious topics, as if he justly appreciated the
importance of the subject, and was no stranger to its
discussion.&nbsp; Still, he indulged a number of unreasonable
prejudices against Christianity, which he regarded less in its
real nature than its abuses.&nbsp; The superficial philosophy
which preceded the French revolution had dazzled him.&nbsp; He
had formed an idea that religious worship might be offered up
with greater purity than as it had been dictated by the religion
of the Evangelists.&nbsp; Without any intimate acquaintance with
the writings of Condillac and Tracy, he venerated them as the
most profound thinkers, and really thought that the last had
carried the branch of metaphysics to the highest degree of
perfection.</p>
<p>I may fairly say that <i>my</i> philosophical studies had been
better directed; I was aware of the weakness of the experimental
doctrine, and I knew the gross and shameless errors in point of
criticism, which influenced the age of Voltaire in libelling
Christianity.&nbsp; I had also read Gu&eacute;n&eacute;e, and
other able exposers of such false criticism.&nbsp; I felt a
conviction that, by no logical reasoning, could the being of a
God be granted, and the Bible rejected, and I conceived it a
vulgar degradation to fall in with the stream of antichristian
opinions, and to want elevation of intellect to apprehend how the
doctrine of Catholicism in its true character, is religiously
simple and ennobling.&nbsp; Yet I had the meanness to bow to
human opinion out of deference and respect.&nbsp; The wit and
sarcasms of my neighbour seemed to confound me, while I could not
disguise from myself that they were idle and empty as the
air.&nbsp; I dissimulated, I hesitated to announce my own belief,
reflecting how far it were seasonable thus to contradict my
companion, and persuading myself that it would be useless, and
that I was perfectly justified in remaining silent.&nbsp; What
vile pusillanimity! why thus respect the presumptuous power of
popular errors and opinions, resting upon no foundation.&nbsp;
True it is that an ill-timed zeal is always indiscreet, and
calculated to irritate rather than convert; but to avow with
frankness and modesty what we regard as an important truth, to do
it even when we have reason to conclude it will not be palatable,
and to meet willingly any ridicule or sarcasm which may be
launched against it; this I maintain to be an actual duty.&nbsp;
A noble avowal of this kind, moreover, may always be made,
without pretending to assume, uncalled for, anything of the
missionary character.</p>
<p>It is, I repeat, a duty, not to keep back an important truth
at any period; for though there may be little hope of it being
immediately acknowledged; it may tend to prepare the minds of
others, and in due time, doubtless, produce a better and more
impartial judgment, and a consequent triumph of truth.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">continued</span> in the same apartment
during a month and some days.&nbsp; On the night of February the
18th, 1821, I was roused from sleep by a loud noise of chains and
keys; several men entered with a lantern, and the first idea that
struck me was, that they were come to cut my throat.&nbsp; While
gazing at them in strange perplexity, one of the figures advanced
towards me with a polite air; it was Count B&mdash;, <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a> who requested I would dress myself as
speedily as possible to set out.</p>
<p>I was surprised at this announcement, and even indulged a hope
that they were sent to conduct me to the confines of
Piedmont.&nbsp; Was it likely the storm which hung over me would
thus early be dispersed? should I again enjoy that liberty so
dearly prized, be restored to my beloved parents, and see my
brothers and sisters?</p>
<p>I was allowed short time to indulge these flattering
hopes.&nbsp; The moment I had thrown on my clothes, I followed my
conductors without having an opportunity of bidding farewell to
my royal neighbour.&nbsp; Yet I thought I heard him call my name,
and regretted it was out of my power to stop and reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; I inquired of the Count, as we
got into a coach, attended by an officer of the guard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I cannot inform you till we shall be a mile on the other
side the city of Milan.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was aware the coach was
not going in the direction of the Vercelline gate; and my hopes
suddenly vanished.&nbsp; I was silent; it was a beautiful
moonlight night; I beheld the same well-known paths I had
traversed for pleasure so many years before.&nbsp; The houses,
the churches, and every object renewed a thousand pleasing
recollections.&nbsp; I saw the <i>Corsia</i> of Porta Orientale,
I saw the public gardens, where I had so often rambled with
Foscolo, <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a> Monti, <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a> Lodovico di Breme,
<a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> Pietro Borsieri, <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a> Count Porro, and his sons, with many
other delightful companions, conversing in all the glow of life
and hope.&nbsp; How I felt my friendship for these noble men
revive with double force when I thought of having parted from
them for the last time, disappearing as they had done, one by
one, so rapidly from my view.&nbsp; When we had gone a little way
beyond the gate, I pulled my hat over my eyes, and indulged these
sad retrospections unobserved.</p>
<p>After having gone about a mile, I addressed myself to Count
B-.&nbsp; &ldquo;I presume we are on the road to
Verona.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, further,&rdquo; was the reply;
&ldquo;we are for Venice, where it is my duty to hand you over to
a special commission there appointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We travelled post, stopped nowhere, and on the 20th of
February arrived at my destination.&nbsp; The September of the
year preceding, just one month previous to my arrest, I had been
at Venice, and had met a large and delightful party at dinner, in
the Hotel della Luna.&nbsp; Strangely enough, I was now conducted
by the Count and the officer to the very inn where we had spent
that evening in social mirth.</p>
<p>One of the waiters started on seeing me, perceiving that,
though my conductors had assumed the dress of domestics, I was no
other than a prisoner in their hands.&nbsp; I was gratified at
this recognition, being persuaded that the man would mention my
arrival there to more than one.</p>
<p>We dined, and I was then conducted to the palace of the Doge,
where the tribunals are now held.&nbsp; I passed under the
well-known porticoes of the <i>Procuratie</i>, and by the Florian
Hotel, where I had enjoyed so many pleasant evenings the last
autumn; but I did not happen to meet a single acquaintance.&nbsp;
We went across the piazzetta, and there it struck me that the
September before, I had met a poor mendicant, who addressed me in
these singular words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, sir, you are a stranger, but I cannot make out
why you, sir, and all other strangers, should so much admire this
place.&nbsp; To me it is a place of misfortune, and I never pass
it when I can avoid it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, did you here meet with some disaster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, sir; a horrible one, sir; and not only I.&nbsp;
God protect you from it, God protect you!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
took himself off in haste.</p>
<p>At this moment it was impossible for me to forget the words of
the poor beggarman.&nbsp; He was present there, too, the next
year, when I ascended the scaffold, whence I heard read to me the
sentence of death, and that it had been commuted for fifteen
years hard imprisonment.&nbsp; Assuredly, if I had been inclined
ever so little to superstition, I should have thought much of the
mendicant, predicting to me with so much energy, as he did, and
insisting that this was a place of misfortune.&nbsp; As it is, I
have merely noted it down for a curious incident.&nbsp; We
ascended the palace; Count B&mdash; spoke to the judges, then,
handing me over to the jailer, after embracing me with much
emotion, he bade me farewell.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">followed</span> the jailer in
silence.&nbsp; After turning through a number of passages, and
several large rooms, we arrived at a small staircase, which
brought us under the <i>Piombi</i>, those notorious state
prisons, dating from the time of the Venetian republic.</p>
<p>There the jailer first registered my name, and then locked me
up in the room appointed for me.&nbsp; The chambers called <i>I
Piombi</i> consist of the upper portion of the Doge&rsquo;s
palace, and are covered throughout with lead.</p>
<p>My room had a large window with enormous bars, and commanded a
view of the roof (also of lead), and the church, of St.
Mark.&nbsp; Beyond the church I could discern the end of the
Piazza in the distance, with an immense number of cupolas and
belfries on all sides.&nbsp; St. Mark&rsquo;s gigantic Campanile
was separated from me only by the length of the church, and I
could hear persons speaking from the top of it when they talked
at all loud.&nbsp; To the left of the church was to be seen a
portion of the grand court of the palace, and one of the chief
entrances.&nbsp; There is a public well in that part of the
court, and people were continually in the habit of going thither
to draw water.&nbsp; From the lofty site of my prison they
appeared to me about the size of little children, and I could not
at all hear their conversation, except when they called out very
loud.&nbsp; Indeed, I found myself much more solitary than I had
been in the Milanese prisons.</p>
<p>During several days the anxiety I suffered from the criminal
trial appointed by the special commission, made me rather
melancholy, and it was increased, doubtless, by that painful
feeling of deeper solitude.</p>
<p>I was here, moreover, further removed from my family, of whom
I heard no more.&nbsp; The new faces that appeared wore a gloom
at once strange and appalling.&nbsp; Report had greatly
exaggerated the struggle of the Milanese and the rest of Italy to
recover their independence; it was doubted if I were not one of
the most desperate promoters of that mad enterprise.&nbsp; I
found that my name, as a writer, was not wholly unknown to my
jailer, to his wife, and even his daughter, besides two sons, and
the under-jailers, all of whom, by their manner, seemed to have
an idea that a writer of tragedies was little better than a kind
of magician.&nbsp; They looked grave and distant, yet as if eager
to learn more of me, had they dared to waive the ceremony of
their iron office.</p>
<p>In a few days I grew accustomed to their looks, or rather, I
think, they found I was not so great a necromancer as to escape
through the lead roofs, and, consequently, assumed a more
conciliating demeanour.&nbsp; The wife had most of the character
that marks the true jailer; she was dry and hard, all bone,
without a particle of heart, about forty, and incapable of
feeling, except it were a savage sort of instinct for her
offspring.&nbsp; She used to bring me my coffee, morning and
afternoon, and my water at dinner.&nbsp; She was generally
accompanied by her daughter, a girl of about fifteen, not very
pretty, but with mild, compassionating looks, and her two sons,
from ten to thirteen years of age.&nbsp; They always went back
with their mother, but there was a gentle look and a smile of
love for me upon their young faces as she closed the door, my
only company when they were gone.&nbsp; The jailer never came
near me, except to conduct me before the special commission, that
terrible ordeal for what are termed crimes of state.</p>
<p>The under-jailers, occupied with the prisons of the police,
situated on a lower floor, where there were numbers of robbers,
seldom came near me.&nbsp; One of these assistants was an old
man, more than seventy, but still able to discharge his laborious
duties, and to run up and down the steps to the different
prisons; another was a young man about twenty-five, more bent
upon giving an account of his love affairs than eager to devote
himself to his office.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> now to confront the terrors
of a state trial.&nbsp; What was my dread of implicating others
by my answers!&nbsp; What difficulty to contend against so many
strange accusations, so many suspicions of all kinds!&nbsp; How
impossible, almost, not to become implicated by these incessant
examinations, by daily new arrests, and the imprudence of other
parties, perhaps not known to you, yet belonging to the same
movement!&nbsp; I have decided not to speak on politics; and I
must suppress every detail connected with the state trials.&nbsp;
I shall merely observe that, after being subjected for successive
hours to the harassing process, I retired in a frame of mind so
excited, and so enraged, that I should assuredly have taken my
own life, had not the voice of religion, and the recollection of
my parents restrained my hand.&nbsp; I lost the tranquillity of
mind I had acquired at Milan; during many days, I despaired of
regaining it, and I cannot even allude to this interval without
feelings of horror.&nbsp; It was vain to attempt it, I could not
pray; I questioned the justice of God; I cursed mankind, and all
the world, revolving in my mind all the possible sophisms and
satires I could think of, respecting the hollowness and vanity of
virtue.&nbsp; The disappointed and the exasperated are always
ingenious in finding accusations against their fellow-creatures,
and even the Creator himself.&nbsp; Anger is of a more universal
and injurious tendency than is generally supposed.&nbsp; As we
cannot rage and storm from morning till night, and as the most
ferocious animal has necessarily its intervals of repose, these
intervals in man are greatly influenced by the immoral character
of the conduct which may have preceded them.&nbsp; He appears to
be at peace, indeed, but it is an irreligious, malignant peace; a
savage sardonic smile, destitute of all charity or dignity; a
love of confusion, intoxication, and sarcasm.</p>
<p>In this state I was accustomed to sing&mdash;anything but
hymns&mdash;with a kind of mad, ferocious joy.&nbsp; I spoke to
all who approached my dungeon, jeering and bitter things; and I
tried to look upon the whole creation through the medium of that
commonplace wisdom, the wisdom of the cynics.&nbsp; This
degrading period, on which I hate to reflect, lasted happily only
for six or seven days, during which my Bible had become covered
with dust.&nbsp; One of the jailer&rsquo;s boys, thinking to
please me, as he cast his eye upon it, observed, &ldquo;Since you
left off reading that great, ugly book, you don&rsquo;t seem half
so melancholy, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; Taking the Bible in my hands, I wiped off the dust,
and opening it hastily, my eyes fell upon the following
words:&mdash;&ldquo;And he said unto his disciples, it must needs
be that offences come; but woe unto him by whom they come; for
better had it been for him that a millstone were hanged about his
neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of
these little ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was affected upon reading this passage, and I felt ashamed
when I thought that this little boy had perceived, from the dust
with which it was covered, that I no longer read my Bible, and
had even supposed that I had acquired a better temper by want of
attention to my religious duties, and become less wretched by
forgetting my God.&nbsp; &ldquo;You little graceless
fellow,&rdquo; I exclaimed, though reproaching him in a gentle
tone, and grieved at having afforded him a subject of scandal;
&ldquo;this is not a great, ugly book, and for the few days that
I have left off reading it, I find myself much worse.&nbsp; If
your mother would let you stay with me a little while, you would
see that I know how to get rid of my ill-humour.&nbsp; If you
knew how hard it was to be in good humour, when left so long
alone, and when you hear me singing and talking like a madman,
you would not call this a great ugly book.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boy left me, and I felt a sort
of pleasure at having taken the Bible again in my hands, more
especially at having owned I had been worse for having neglected
it.&nbsp; It seemed as if I had made atonement to a generous
friend whom I had unjustly offended, but had now become
reconciled to.&nbsp; Yes! I had even forgotten my God! I
exclaimed, and perverted my better nature.&nbsp; Could I have
been led to believe that the vile mockery of the cynic was
applicable to one in my forlorn and desperate situation?</p>
<p>I felt an indescribable emotion on asking myself this
question; I placed the Bible upon a chair, and, falling on my
knees, I burst into tears of remorse: I who ever found it so
difficult to shed even a tear.&nbsp; These tears were far more
delightful to me than any physical enjoyment I had ever
felt.&nbsp; I felt I was restored to God, I loved him, I repented
of having outraged religion by degrading myself; and I made a vow
never, never more to forget, to separate myself from, my God.</p>
<p>How truly a sincere return to faith, and love, and hope,
consoles and elevates the mind.&nbsp; I read and continued to
weep for upwards of an hour.&nbsp; I rose with renewed confidence
that God had not abandoned me, but had forgiven my every fault
and folly.&nbsp; It was then that my misfortunes, the horrors of
my continued examinations, and the probable death which awaited
me, appeared of little account.&nbsp; I rejoiced in suffering,
since I was thus afforded an occasion to perform some duty, and
that, by submitting with a resigned mind, I was obeying my Divine
Master.&nbsp; I was enabled, thanks be to Heaven, to read my
Bible.&nbsp; I no longer estimated it by the wretched, critical
subterfuges of a Voltaire, heaping ridicule upon mere
expressions, in themselves neither false nor ridiculous, except
to gross ignorance or malice, which cannot penetrate their
meaning.&nbsp; I became clearly convinced how indisputably it was
the code of sanctity, and hence of truth itself; how really
unphilosophical it was to take offence at a few little
imperfections of style, not less absurd than the vanity of one
who despises everything that wears not the gloss of elegant
forms; what still greater absurdity to imagine that such a
collection of books, so long held in religious veneration, should
not possess an authentic origin, boasting, as they do, such a
vast superiority over the Koran, and the old theology of the
Indies.</p>
<p>Many, doubtless, abused its excellence, many wished to turn it
into a code of injustice, and a sanction of all their bad
passions.&nbsp; But the triumphant answer to these is, that every
thing is liable to abuse; and when did the abuse of the most
precious and best of things lead us to the conclusion that they
were in their own nature bad?&nbsp; Our Saviour himself declared
it; the whole law and the Prophets, the entire body of these
sacred books, all inculcate the same precept to love God and
mankind.&nbsp; And must not such writings embrace the
truth&mdash;truth adapted to all times and ages? must they not
ever constitute the living word of the Holy Spirit?</p>
<p>Whilst I made these reflections, I renewed my intention of
identifying with religion all my thoughts concerning human
affairs, all my opinions upon the progress of civilisation, my
philanthropy, love of my country, in short, all the passions of
my mind.</p>
<p>The few days in which I remained subjected to the cynic
doctrine, did me a deal of harm.&nbsp; I long felt its effects,
and had great difficulty to remove them.&nbsp; Whenever man
yields in the least to the temptation of undignifying his
intellect, to view the works of God through the infernal medium
of scorn, to abandon the beneficent exercise of prayer, the
injury which he inflicts upon his natural reason prepares him to
fall again with but little struggle.&nbsp; For a period of
several weeks I was almost daily assaulted with strong, bitter
tendencies to doubt and disbelief; and it called for the whole
power of my mind to free myself from their grasp.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> these mental struggles had
ceased, and I had again become habituated to reverence the Deity
in all my thoughts and feelings, I for some time enjoyed the most
unbroken serenity and peace.&nbsp; The examinations to which I
was every two or three days subjected by the special commission,
however tormenting, produced no lasting anxiety, as before.&nbsp;
I succeeded in this arduous position, in discharging all which
integrity and friendship required of me, and left the rest to the
will of God.&nbsp; I now, too, resumed my utmost efforts to guard
against the effects of any sudden surprise, every emotion and
passion, and every imaginable misfortune; a kind of preparation
for future trials of the greatest utility.</p>
<p>My solitude, meantime, grew more oppressive.&nbsp; Two sons of
the jailer, whom I had been in the habit of seeing at brief
intervals, were sent to school, and I saw them no more.&nbsp; The
mother and the sister, who had been accustomed, along with them,
to speak to me, never came near me, except to bring my
coffee.&nbsp; About the mother I cared very little; but the
daughter, though rather plain, had something so pleasing and
gentle, both in her words and looks, that I greatly felt the loss
of them.&nbsp; Whenever she brought the coffee, and said,
&ldquo;It was I who made it,&rdquo; I always thought it
excellent: but when she observed, &ldquo;This is my
mother&rsquo;s making,&rdquo; it lost all its relish.</p>
<p>Being almost deprived of human society, I one day made
acquaintance with some ants upon my window; I fed them; they went
away, and ere long the placed was thronged with these little
insects, as if come by invitation.&nbsp; A spider, too, had
weaved a noble edifice upon my walls, and I often gave him a
feast of gnats or flies, which were extremely annoying to me, and
which he liked much better than I did.&nbsp; I got quite
accustomed to the sight of him; he would run over my bed, and
come and take the precious morsels out of my hand.&nbsp; Would to
heaven these had been the only insects which visited my
abode.&nbsp; It was still summer, and the gnats had begun to
multiply to a prodigious and alarming extent.&nbsp; The previous
winter had been remarkably mild, and after the prevalence of the
March winds followed extreme heat.&nbsp; It is impossible to
convey an idea of the insufferable oppression of the air in the
place I occupied.&nbsp; Opposed directly to a noontide sun, under
a leaden roof, and with a window looking on the roof of St. Mark,
casting a tremendous reflection of the heat, I was nearly
suffocated.&nbsp; I had never conceived an idea of a punishment
so intolerable: add to which the clouds of gnats, which, spite of
my utmost efforts, covered every article of furniture in the
room, till even the walls and ceiling seemed alive with them; and
I had some apprehension of being devoured alive.&nbsp; Their
bites, moreover, were extremely painful, and when thus punctured
from morning till night, only to undergo the same operation from
day to day, and engaged the whole time in killing and slaying,
some idea may be formed of the state both of my body and my
mind.</p>
<p>I felt the full force of such a scourge, yet was unable to
obtain a change of dungeon, till at length I was tempted to rid
myself of my life, and had strong fears of running
distracted.&nbsp; But, thanks be to God, these thoughts were not
of long duration, and religion continued to sustain me.&nbsp; It
taught me that man was born to suffer, and to suffer with
courage: it taught me to experience a sort of pleasure in my
troubles, to resist and to vanquish in the battle appointed me by
Heaven.&nbsp; The more unhappy, I said to myself, my life may
become, the less will I yield to my fate, even though I should be
condemned in the morning of my life to the scaffold.&nbsp;
Perhaps, without these preliminary and chastening trials, I might
have met death in an unworthy manner.&nbsp; Do I know, moreover,
that I possess those virtues and qualities which deserve
prosperity; where and what are they?&nbsp; Then, seriously
examining into my past conduct, I found too little good on which
to pride myself; the chief part was a tissue of vanity, idolatry,
and the mere exterior of virtue.&nbsp; Unworthy, therefore, as I
am, let me suffer!&nbsp; If it be intended that men and gnats
should destroy me, unjustly or otherwise, acknowledge in them the
instruments of a divine justice, and be silent.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Does</span> man stand in need of
compulsion before he can be brought to humble himself with
sincerity? to look upon himself as a sinner?&nbsp; Is it not too
true that we in general dissipate our youth in vanity, and,
instead of employing all our faculties in the acquisition of what
is good, make them the instruments of our degradation?&nbsp;
There are, doubtless, exceptions, but I confess they cannot apply
to a wretched individual like myself.&nbsp; There is no merit in
thus being dissatisfied with myself; when we see a lamp which
emits more smoke than flame, it requires no great sincerity to
say that it does not burn as it ought to do.</p>
<p>Yes, without any degradation, without any scruples of
hypocrisy, and viewing myself with perfect tranquillity of mind,
I perceived that I had merited the chastisement of my God.&nbsp;
An internal monitor told me that such chastisements were, for one
fault or other, amply merited; they assisted in winning me back
to Him who is perfect, and whom every human being, as far as
their limited powers will admit, are bound to imitate.&nbsp; By
what right, while constrained to condemn myself for innumerable
offences and forgetfulness towards God, could I complain, because
some men appeared to me despicable, and others wicked?&nbsp; What
if I were deprived of all worldly advantages, and was doomed to
linger in prison, or to die a violent death?&nbsp; I sought to
impress upon my mind reflections like these, at once just and
applicable; and this done, I found it was necessary to be
consistent, and that it could be effected in no other manner than
by sanctifying the upright judgments of the Almighty, by loving
them, and eradicating every wish at all opposed to them.&nbsp;
The better to persevere in my intention, I determined, in future,
carefully to revolve in my mind all my opinions, by committing
them to writing.&nbsp; The difficulty was that the Commission,
while permitting me to have the use of ink and paper, counted out
the leaves, with an express prohibition that I should not destroy
a single one, and reserving the power of examining in what manner
I had employed them.&nbsp; To supply the want of paper, I had
recourse to the simple stratagem of smoothing with a piece of
glass a rude table which I had, and upon this I daily wrote my
long meditations respecting the duties of mankind, and especially
of those which applied to myself.&nbsp; It is no exaggeration to
say that the hours so employed were sometimes delightful to me,
notwithstanding the difficulty of breathing I experienced from
the excessive heat, to say nothing of the bitterly painful
wounds, small though they were, of those poisonous gnats.&nbsp;
To defend myself from the countless numbers of these tormentors,
I was compelled, in the midst of suffocation, to wrap my head and
my legs in thick cloth, and not only write with gloves on, but to
bandage my wrist to prevent the intruders creeping up my
sleeves.</p>
<p>Meditations like mine assumed somewhat of a biographical
character.&nbsp; I made out an account of all the good and the
evil which had grown up with me from my earliest youth,
discussing them within myself, attempting to resolve every doubt,
and arranging, to the best of my power, the various kinds of
knowledge I had acquired, and my ideas upon every subject.&nbsp;
When the whole surface of the table was covered with my
lucubrations, I perused and re-perused them, meditated on what I
had already meditated, and, at length, resolved (however
unwillingly) to scratch out all I had done with the glass, in
order to have a clean superficies upon which to recommence my
operations.</p>
<p>From that time I continued the narrative of my experience of
good and evil, always relieved by digressions of every kind, by
some analysis of this or that point, whether in metaphysics,
morals, politics, or religion; and when the whole was complete, I
again began to read, and re-read, and lastly, to scratch
out.&nbsp; Being anxious to avoid every chance of interruption,
or of impediment, to my repeating with the greatest possible
freedom the facts I had recorded, and my opinions upon them, I
took care to transpose and abbreviate the words in such a manner
as to run no risk from the most inquisitorial visit.&nbsp; No
search, however, was made, and no one was aware that I was
spending my miserable prison-hours to so good a purpose.&nbsp;
Whenever I heard the jailer or other person open the door I
covered my little table with a cloth, and placed upon it the
ink-stand, with the <i>lawful</i> quantity of state paper by its
side.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Still</span> I did not wholly neglect the
paper put into my hands, and sometimes even devoted an entire day
or night to writing.&nbsp; But here I only treated of literary
matters.&nbsp; I composed at that time the <i>Ester
d&rsquo;Engaddi</i>, the <i>Iginia d&rsquo;Asti</i>, and the
<i>Cantichi</i>, entitled, <i>Tanereda Rosilde</i>, <i>Eligi</i>
and <i>Valafrido</i>, <i>Adello</i>, besides several sketches of
tragedies, and other productions, in the list of which was a poem
upon the <i>Lombard League</i>, and another upon <i>Christopher
Columbus</i>.</p>
<p>As it was not always so easy an affair to get a reinforcement
of paper, I was in the habit of committing my rough draughts to
my table, or the wrapping-paper in which I received fruit and
other articles.&nbsp; At times I would give away my dinner to the
under-jailer, telling him that I had no appetite, and then
requesting from him the favour of a sheet of paper.&nbsp; This
was, however, only in certain exigencies, when my little table
was full of writing, and I had not yet determined on clearing it
away.&nbsp; I was often very hungry, and though the jailer had
money of mine in his possession, I did not ask him to bring me
anything to eat, partly lest he should suspect I had given away
my dinner, and partly that the under-jailer might not find out
that I had said the thing which was not when I assured him of my
loss of appetite.&nbsp; In the evening I regaled myself with some
strong coffee, and I entreated that it might be made by the
little <i>sioa</i>, Zanze. <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; This was the
jailer&rsquo;s daughter, who, if she could escape the lynx-eye of
her sour mamma, was good enough to make it exceedingly good; so
good, indeed, that, what with the emptiness of my stomach, it
produced a kind of convulsion, which kept me awake the whole of
the night.</p>
<p>In this state of gentle inebriation, I felt my intellectual
faculties strangely invigorated; wrote poetry, philosophized, and
prayed till morning with feelings of real pleasure.&nbsp; I then
became completely exhausted, threw myself upon my bed, and, spite
of the gnats that were continually sucking my blood, I slept an
hour or two in profound rest.</p>
<p>I can hardly describe the peculiar and pleasing exaltation of
mind which continued for nights together, and I left no means
untried to secure the same means of continuing it.&nbsp; With
this view I still refused to touch a mouthful of dinner, even
when I was in no want of paper, merely in order to obtain my
magic beverage for the evening.</p>
<p>How fortunate I thought myself when I succeeded; not
unfrequently the coffee was not made by the gentle Angiola; and
it was always vile stuff from her mother&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; In
this last case, I was sadly put out of humour, for instead of the
electrical effect on my nerves, it made me wretched, weak, and
hungry; I threw myself down to sleep, but was unable to close an
eye.&nbsp; Upon these occasions I complained bitterly to Angiola,
the jailer&rsquo;s daughter, and one day, as if she had been in
fault, I scolded her so sharply that the poor girl began to weep,
sobbing out, &ldquo;Indeed, sir, I never deceived anybody, and
yet everybody calls me a deceitful little mix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody!&nbsp; Oh then, I see I am not the only one
driven to distraction by your vile slops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not mean to say that, sir.&nbsp; Ah, if you only
knew; if I dared to tell you all that my poor, wretched
heart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t cry so!&nbsp; What is all this
ado?&nbsp; I beg your pardon, you see, if I scolded you.&nbsp;
Indeed, I believe you would not, you could not, make me such vile
stuff as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&nbsp; I am not crying about that,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not!&rdquo; and I felt my self-love not a
little mortified, though I forced a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
crying, then, because I scolded you, and yet not about the
coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! then who called you a little deceitful one
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> did, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> did; and who is <i>he</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lover, sir;&rdquo; and she hid her face in her
little hands.</p>
<p>Afterwards she ingenuously intrusted to my keeping, and I
could not well betray her, a little serio-comic sort of pastoral
romance, which really interested me.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> that day forth, I know not
why, I became the adviser and confidant of this young girl, who
returned and conversed with me for hours.&nbsp; She at first
said, &ldquo;You are so good, sir, that I feel just the same when
I am here as if I were your own daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a very poor compliment,&rdquo; replied I,
dropping her hand; &ldquo;I am hardly yet thirty-two, and you
look upon me as if I were an old father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not so; I mean as a brother, to be sure;&rdquo;
and she insisted upon taking hold of my hand with an air of the
most innocent confidence and affection.</p>
<p>I am glad, thought I to myself, that you are no beauty; else,
alas, this innocent sort of fooling might chance to disconcert
me; at other times I thought it is lucky, too, she is so young,
there could never be any danger of becoming attached to girls of
her years.&nbsp; At other times, however, I felt a little uneasy,
thinking I was mistaken in having pronounced her rather plain,
whereas her whole shape and features were by no means wanting in
proportion or expression.&nbsp; If she were not quite so pale, I
said, and her face free from those marks, she might really pass
for a beauty.&nbsp; It is impossible, in fact, not to find some
charm in the presence and in the looks and voice of a young girl
full of vivacity and affection.&nbsp; I had taken not the least
pains to acquire her good-will; yet was I as dear to either as a
father or a brother, whichever title I preferred.&nbsp; And
why?&nbsp; Only because she had read <i>Francesca da Rimini</i>
and <i>Eufemio</i>, and my poems, she said, had made her weep so
often; then, besides, I was a solitary prisoner, <i>without
having</i>, as she observed, either robbed or murdered
anybody.</p>
<p>In short, when I had become attached to poor Maddalene,
without once seeing her, how was it likely that I could remain
indifferent to the sisterly assiduity and attentions, to the
thousand pleasing little compliments, and to the most delicious
cups of coffee of this young Venice girl, my gentle little
jailer? <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp; I should be trying to impose on
myself, were I to attribute to my own prudence the fact of my not
having fallen in love with Angiola.&nbsp; I did not do so, simply
from the circumstance of her having already a lover of her own
choosing, to whom she was desperately, unalterably
attached.&nbsp; Heaven help me! if it had not been thus I should
have found myself in a very <i>critical</i> position, indeed, for
an author, with so little to keep alive his attention.&nbsp; The
sentiment I felt for her was not, then, what is called
love.&nbsp; I wished to see her happy, and that she might be
united to the lover of her choice; I was not jealous, nor had I
the remotest idea she could ever select me as the object of her
regard.&nbsp; Still, when I heard my prison-door open, my heart
began to beat in the hope it was my Angiola; and if she appeared
not, I experienced a peculiar kind of vexation; when she really
came my heart throbbed yet more violently, from a feeling of pure
joy.&nbsp; Her parents, who had begun to entertain a good opinion
of me, and were aware of her passionate regard for another,
offered no opposition to the visits she thus made me, permitting
her almost invariably to bring me my coffee in a morning, and not
unfrequently in the evening.</p>
<p>There was altogether a simplicity and an affectionateness in
her every word, look, and gesture, which were really
captivating.&nbsp; She would say, &ldquo;I am excessively
attached to another, and yet I take such delight in being near
you!&nbsp; When I am not in <i>his</i> company, I like being
nowhere so well as here.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Here was another
compliment.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you know why?&rdquo; inquired I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you, then.&nbsp; It is because I permit you
to talk about your lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a good guess; yet still I think it is a good
deal because I esteem you so very much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor girl! along with this pretty frankness she had that
blessed sin of taking me always by the hand, and pressing it with
all her heart, not perceiving that she at once pleased and
disconcerted me by her affectionate manner.&nbsp; Thanks be to
Heaven, that I can always recall this excellent little girl to
mind without the least tinge of remorse.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following portion of my
narrative would assuredly have been more interesting had the
gentle Angiola fallen in love with me, or if I had at least run
half mad to enliven my solitude.&nbsp; There was, however,
another sentiment, that of simple benevolence, no less dear to
me, which united our hearts in one.&nbsp; And if, at any moment,
I felt there was the least risk of its changing its nature in my
vain, weak heart, it produced only sincere regret.</p>
<p>Once, certainly, having my doubts that this would happen, and
finding her, to my sorrow, a hundred times more beautiful than I
had at first imagined; feeling too so very melancholy when she
was absent, so joyous when near, I took upon myself to play the
<i>unamiable</i>, in the idea that this would remove all danger
by making her leave off the same affectionate and familiar
manner.&nbsp; This innocent stratagem was tried in vain; the poor
girl was so patient, so full of compassion for me.&nbsp; She
would look at me in silence, with her elbow resting upon the
window, and say, after a long pause, &ldquo;I see, sir, you are
tired of my company, yet <i>I</i> would stay here the whole day
if I could, merely to keep the hours from hanging so heavy upon
you.&nbsp; This ill-humour of yours is the natural effect of your
long solitude; if you were able to chat awhile, you would be
quite well again.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t like to talk, I will
talk for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About your lover, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; not always about him; I can talk of many
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then began to give me some extracts from the household
annals, dwelling upon the sharp temper of her mother, her
good-natured father, and the monkey-tricks of her little
brothers; and she told all this with a simple grace and innocent
frankness not a little alluring.&nbsp; Yet I was pretty near the
truth; for, without being aware of it, she uniformly concluded
with the one favourite theme: her ill-starred love.&nbsp; Still I
went on acting the part of the <i>unamiable</i>, in the hope that
she would take a spite against me.&nbsp; But whether from
inadvertency or design, she would not take the hint, and I was at
last fairly compelled to give up by sitting down contented to let
her have her way, smiling, sympathising with, and thanking her
for the sweet patience with which she had so long borne with
me.</p>
<p>I no longer indulged the ungracious idea of spiting her
against me, and, by degrees, all my other fears were
allayed.&nbsp; Assuredly I had not been smitten; I long examined
into the nature of my scruples, wrote down my reflections upon
the subject, and derived no little advantage from the
process.</p>
<p>Man often terrifies himself with mere bugbears of the
mind.&nbsp; If we would learn not to fear them, we have only to
examine them a little more nearly and attentively.&nbsp; What
harm, then, if I looked forward to her visits to me with a tender
anxiety, if I appreciated their sweetness, if it did me good to
be compassioned by her, and to interchange all our thoughts and
feelings, unsullied, I will say, as those of childhood.&nbsp;
Even her most affectionate looks, and smiles, and pressures of
the hand, while they agitated me, produced a feeling of salutary
respect mingled with compassion.&nbsp; One evening, I remember,
when suffering under a sad misfortune, the poor girl threw her
arms round my neck, and wept as if her heart would break.&nbsp;
She had not the least idea of impropriety; no daughter could
embrace a father with more perfect innocence and unsuspecting
affection.&nbsp; I could not, however, reflect upon that embrace
without feeling somewhat agitated.&nbsp; It often recurred to my
imagination, and I could then think of no other subject.&nbsp; On
another occasion, when she thus threw herself upon my confidence,
I was really obliged to disentangle myself from her dear arms,
ere I once pressed her to my bosom, or gave her a single kiss,
while I stammered out, &ldquo;I pray you, now, sweet Angiola, do
not embrace me ever again; it is not quite proper.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She fixed her eyes upon me for a moment, then cast them down,
while a blush suffused her ingenuous countenance; and I am sure
it was the first time that she read in my mind even the
possibility of any weakness of mine in reference to her.&nbsp;
Still she did not cease to continue her visits upon the same
friendly footing, with a little mere reserve and respect, such as
I wished it to be; and I was grateful to her for it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> unable to form an estimate of
the evils which afflict others; but, as respects myself, I am
bound to confess that, after close examination, I found that no
sufferings had been appointed me, except to some wise end, and
for my own advantage.&nbsp; It was thus even with the excessive
heat which oppressed, and the gnats which tormented me.&nbsp;
Often have I reflected that but for this continual suffering I
might not have successfully resisted the temptation of falling in
love, situated as I was, and with one whose extremely
affectionate and ardent feelings would have made it difficult
always to preserve it within respectful limits.&nbsp; If I had
sometimes reason to tremble, how should I have been enabled to
regulate my vain imagination in an atmosphere somewhat inspiring,
and open to the breathings of joy.</p>
<p>Considering the imprudence of Angiola&rsquo;s parents, who
reposed such confidence in me, the imprudence of the poor girl
herself, who had not an idea of giving rise to any culpable
affection on my part, and considering, too, the little
steadfastness of my virtue, there can be little doubt but the
suffocating heat of my great oven, and the cruel warfare of the
gnats, were effectual safeguards to us both.</p>
<p>Such a reflection reconciled me somewhat to these scourges;
and I then asked myself, Would you consent to become free, and to
take possession of some handsome apartment, filled with flowers
and fresh air, on condition of never more seeing this
affectionate being?&nbsp; I will own the truth; I had not courage
to reply to this simple question.</p>
<p>When you really feel interested about any one, it is
indescribable what mere trifles are capable of conferring
pleasure.&nbsp; A single word, a smile, a tear, a Venetian turn
of expression, her eagerness in protecting me from my enemies,
the gnats, all inspired me with a childish delight that lasted
the whole day.&nbsp; What most gratified me was to see that her
own sufferings seemed to be relieved by conversing with me, that
my compassion consoled her, that my advice influenced her, and
that her heart was susceptible of the warmest devotion when
treating of virtue and its great Author.</p>
<p>When we had sometimes discussed the subject of religion, she
would observe, &ldquo;I find that I can now pray with more
willingness and more faith than I did.&rdquo;&nbsp; At other
times, suddenly breaking off some frivolous topic, she took the
Bible, opened it, pressed her lips to it, and then begged of me
to translate some passages, and give my comments.&nbsp; She
added, &ldquo;I could wish that every time you happen to recur to
this passage you should call to mind that I have kissed and
kissed it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not always, indeed, that her kisses fell so
appropriately, more especially if she happened to open at the
spiritual songs.&nbsp; Then, in order to spare her blushes, I
took advantage of her want of acquaintance with the Latin, and
gave a turn to the expressions which, without detracting from the
sacredness of the Bible, might serve to respect her
innocence.&nbsp; On such occasions I never once permitted myself
to smile; at the same time I was not a little perplexed, when,
not rightly comprehending my new version, she entreated of me to
translate the whole, word for word, and would by no means let me
shy the question by turning her attention to something else.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> is durable here
below!&nbsp; Poor Angiola fell sick; and on one of the first days
when she felt indisposed, she came to see me, complaining
bitterly of pains in her head.&nbsp; She wept, too, and would not
explain the cause of her grief.&nbsp; She only murmured something
that looked like reproaches of her lover.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a
villain!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but God forgive him, as I
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left no means untried to obtain her confidence, but it was
the first time I was quite unable to ascertain why she distressed
herself to such an excess.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will return to-morrow
morning,&rdquo; she said, one evening on parting from me;
&ldquo;I will, indeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the next morning came,
and my coffee was brought by her mother; the next, and the next,
by the under-jailers; and Angiola continued grievously ill.&nbsp;
The under-jailers, also, brought me very unpleasant tidings
relating to the love-affair; tidings, in short, which made me
deeply sympathize with her sufferings.&nbsp; A case of
seduction!&nbsp; But, perhaps, it was the tale of calumny.&nbsp;
Alas!&nbsp; I but too well believed it, and I was affected at it
more than I can express; though I still like to flatter myself
that it was false.&nbsp; After upwards of a month&rsquo;s
illness, the poor girl was taken into the country, and I saw her
no more.</p>
<p>It is astonishing how deeply I felt this deprivation, and how
much more horrible my solitude now appeared.&nbsp; Still more
bitter was the reflection that she, who had so tenderly fed, and
watched, and visited me in my sad prison, supplying every want
and wish within her power, was herself a prey to sorrow and
misfortune.&nbsp; Alas! I could make her no return; yet, surely
she will feel aware how truly I sympathize with her; that there
is no effort I would not make to afford her comfort and relief,
and that I shall never cease to offer up my prayers for her, and
to bless her for her goodness to a wretched prisoner.</p>
<p>Though her visits had been too brief, they were enough to
break upon the horrid monotony of my solitude.&nbsp; By
suggesting and comparing our ideas, I obtained new views and
feelings, exercised some of the best and sweetest affections,
gave a zest to life, and even threw a sort of lustre round my
misfortunes.</p>
<p>Suddenly the vision fled, and my dungeon became to me really
like a living tomb.&nbsp; A strange sadness for many days quite
oppressed me.&nbsp; I could not even write: it was a dark, quiet,
nameless feeling, in no way partaking of the violence and
irritation which I had before experienced.&nbsp; Was it that I
had become more inured to adversity, more philosophical, more of
a Christian?&nbsp; Or was it really that the extremely enervating
heat of my dungeon had so prostrated my powers that I could no
longer feel the pangs of excessive grief.&nbsp; Ah, no! for I can
well recollect that I then felt it to my inmost soul; and,
perhaps, more intensely from the want both of will and power to
give vent to it by agitation, maledictions, and cries.&nbsp; The
fact is, I believe, that I had been severely schooled by my past
sufferings, and was resigned to the will of God.&nbsp; I had so
often maintained that it was a mark of cowardice to complain,
that, at length, I succeeded in restraining my passion, when on
the point of breaking out, and felt vexed that I had permitted it
to obtain any ascendancy over me.</p>
<p>My mental faculties were strengthened by the habit of writing
down my thoughts; I got rid of all my vanity, and reduced the
chief part of my reasonings to the following conclusions: There
is a God: <span class="GutSmall">THEREFORE</span> unerring
justice; <span class="GutSmall">THEREFORE</span> all that happens
is ordained to the best end; consequently, the sufferings of man
on earth are inflicted for the good of man.</p>
<p>Thus, my acquaintance with Angiola had proved beneficial, by
soothing and conciliating my feelings.&nbsp; Her good opinion of
me had urged me to the fulfilment of many duties, especially of
that of proving one&rsquo;s self superior to the shocks of
fortune, and of suffering in patience.&nbsp; By exerting myself
to persevere for about a month, I was enabled to feel perfectly
resigned.</p>
<p>Angiola had beheld me two or three times in a downright
passion; once, as I have stated, on account of her having brought
me bad coffee, and a second time as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Every two or three weeks the jailer had brought me a letter
from some of my family.&nbsp; It was previously submitted to the
Commission, and most roughly handled, as was too evident by the
number of <i>erasures</i> in the blackest ink which appeared
throughout.&nbsp; One day, however, instead of merely striking
out a few passages, they drew the black line over the entire
letter, with the exception of the words, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">My Dearest Silvio</span>,&rdquo; at the beginning,
and the parting salutation at the close, &ldquo;<i>All unite in
kindest love to you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This act threw me into such an uncontrollable fit of passion,
that, in presence of the gentle Angiola, I broke out into violent
shouts of rage, and cursed I know not whom.&nbsp; The poor girl
pitied me from her heart; but, at the same time, reminded me of
the strange inconsistency of my principles.&nbsp; I saw she had
reason on her side, and I ceased from uttering my
maledictions.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the under-jailers one day
entered my prison with a mysterious look, and said,
&ldquo;Sometime, I believe, that Siora Zanze (Angiola) . . . was
used to bring you your coffee . . . She stopped a good while to
converse with you, and I was afraid the cunning one would worm
out all your secrets, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one,&rdquo; I replied, in great anger; &ldquo;or if
I had any, I should not be such a fool as to tell them in that
way.&nbsp; Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, sir; far from me to call you by such a name
. . . But I never trusted to that Siora Zanze.&nbsp; And now,
sir, as you have no longer any one to keep you company . . . I
trust I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, what! explain yourself at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear first that you will not betray me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well; I could do that with a safe
conscience.&nbsp; I never betrayed any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you say really you will swear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I swear not to betray you.&nbsp; But what a wretch
to doubt it; for any one capable of betraying you will not
scruple to violate an oath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a letter from his coat-lining, and gave it me with a
trembling hand, beseeching I would destroy it the moment I had
read it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; I cried, opening it; &ldquo;I will read
and destroy it while you are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, you must answer it, and I cannot stop
now.&nbsp; Do it at your leisure.&nbsp; Only take heed, when you
hear any one coming, you will know if it be I by my singing,
pretty loudly, the tune, <i>Sognai mi gera un gato</i>.&nbsp; You
need, then, fear nothing, and may keep the letter quietly in your
pocket.&nbsp; But should you not hear this song, set it down for
a mark that it cannot be me, or that some one is with me.&nbsp;
Then, in a moment, out with it, don&rsquo;t trust to any
concealment, in case of a search; out with it, tear it into a
thousand bits, and throw it through the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon me; I see you are prudent, I will be so
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you called me a stupid wretch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do right to reproach me,&rdquo; I replied, shaking
him by the hand, &ldquo;and I beg your pardon.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
went away, and I began to read</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am (and here followed the name) one of your admirers:
I have all your <i>Francesca da Rimini</i> by heart.&nbsp; They
arrested me for&mdash;(and here he gave the reason with the
date)&mdash;and I would give, I know not how many pounds of my
blood to have the pleasure of being with you, or at least in a
dungeon near yours, in order that we might converse
together.&nbsp; Since I heard from Tremerello, so we shall call
our confidant, that you, sir, were a prisoner, and the cause of
your arrest, I have longed to tell you how deeply I lament your
misfortune, and that no one can feel greater attachment to you
than myself.&nbsp; Have you any objection to accept the offer I
make, namely, that we should try to lighten the burden of our
solitude by writing to each other.&nbsp; I pledge you my honour,
that not a being shall ever hear of our correspondence from me,
and am persuaded that I may count upon the same secresy on your
part, if you adopt my plan.&nbsp; Meantime, that you may form
some idea, I will give you an abstract from my
life.&rdquo;&mdash;(It followed.)</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reader, however deficient in
the imaginative organ, may easily conceive the electric effect of
such a letter upon the nerves of a poor prisoner, not of the most
savage disposition, but possessing an affectionate and gregarious
turn of mind.&nbsp; I felt already an affection for the unknown;
I pitied his misfortunes, and was grateful for the kind
expressions he made use of.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; exclaimed I,
&ldquo;your generous purpose shall be effected.&nbsp; I wish my
letters may afford you consolation equal to that which I shall
derive from yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I re-perused his letter with almost boyish delight, and
blessed the writer; there was not an expression which did not
exhibit evidence of a clear and noble mind.</p>
<p>The sun was setting, it was my hour of prayer; I felt the
presence of God; how sincere was my gratitude for his providing
me with new means of exercising the faculties of my mind.&nbsp;
How it revived my recollection of all the invaluable blessings he
had bestowed upon me!</p>
<p>I stood before the window, with my arms between the bars, and
my hands folded; the church of St. Mark lay below me, an immense
flock of pigeons, free as the air, were flying about, were cooing
and billing, or busied in constructing their nests upon the
leaden roof; the heavens in their magnificence were before me; I
surveyed all that part of Venice visible from my prison; a
distant murmur of human voices broke sweetly on my ear.&nbsp;
From this vast unhappy prison-house did I hold communion with
Him, whose eyes alone beheld me; to Him I recommended my father,
my mother, and, individually, all those most dear to me, and it
appeared as if I heard Him reply, &ldquo;Confide in my
goodness,&rdquo; and I exclaimed, &ldquo;Thy goodness assures
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I concluded my prayer with much emotion, greatly comforted,
and little caring for the bites of the gnats, which had been
joyfully feasting upon me.&nbsp; The same evening, my mind, after
such exaltation, beginning to grow calmer, I found the torment
from the gnats becoming insufferable, and while engaged in
wrapping up my hands and face, a vulgar and malignant idea all at
once entered my mind, which horrified me, and which I vainly
attempted to banish.</p>
<p>Tremerello had insinuated a vile suspicion respecting Angiola;
that, in short, she was a spy upon my secret opinions!&nbsp; She!
that noble-hearted creature, who knew nothing of politics, and
wished to know nothing of them!</p>
<p>It was impossible for me to suspect her; but have I, said I,
the same certainty respecting Tremerello?&nbsp; Suppose that
rogue should be the bribed instrument of secret informers;
suppose the letter had been fabricated by <i>who knows whom</i>,
to induce me to make important disclosures to my new
friend.&nbsp; Perhaps his pretended prison does not exist; or if
so, he may be a traitor, eager to worm out secrets in order to
make his own terms; perhaps he is a man of honour, and Tremerello
himself the traitor who aims at our destruction in order to gain
an additional salary.</p>
<p>Oh, horrible thought, yet too natural to the unhappy prisoner,
everywhere in fear of enmity and fraud!</p>
<p>Such suspicions tormented and degraded me.&nbsp; I did not
entertain them as regarded Angiola a single moment.&nbsp; Yet,
from what Tremerello had said, a kind of doubt clung to me as to
the conduct of those who had permitted her to come into my
apartment.&nbsp; Had they, either from their own zeal, or by
superior authority, given her the office of spy? in that case,
how ill had she discharged such an office!</p>
<p>But what was I to do respecting the letter of the
unknown?&nbsp; Should I adopt the severe, repulsive counsel of
fear which we call prudence?&nbsp; Shall I return the letter to
Tremerello, and tell him, I do not wish to run any risk.&nbsp;
Yet suppose there should be no treason; and the unknown be a
truly worthy character, deserving that I should venture
something, if only to relieve the horrors of his solitude?&nbsp;
Coward as I am, standing on the brink of death, the fatal decree
ready to strike me at any moment, yet to refuse to perform a
simple act of love!&nbsp; Reply to him I must and will.&nbsp;
Grant that it be discovered, no one can fairly be accused of
writing the letter, though poor Tremerello would assuredly meet
with the severest chastisement.&nbsp; Is not this consideration
of itself sufficient to decide me against undertaking any
clandestine correspondence?&nbsp; Is it not my absolute duty to
decline it?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> agitated the whole evening; I
never closed my eyes that night, and amidst so many conflicting
doubts, I knew not on what to resolve.</p>
<p>I sprung from my bed before dawn, I mounted upon the
window-place, and offered up my prayers.&nbsp; In trying
circumstances it is necessary to appeal with confidence to God,
to heed his inspirations, and to adhere to them.</p>
<p>This I did, and after long prayer, I went down, shook off the
gnats, took the bitten gloves in my hands, and came to the
determination to explain my apprehensions to Tremerello and warn
him of the great danger to which he himself was exposed by
bearing letters; to renounce the plan if he wavered, and to
accept it if its terrors did not deter him.&nbsp; I walked about
till I heard the words of the song:&mdash;<i>Segnai mi gera un
gato</i>, <i>E ti me carezzevi</i>.&nbsp; It was Tremerello
bringing me my coffee.&nbsp; I acquainted him with my scruples
and spared nothing to excite his fears.&nbsp; I found him staunch
in his desire to <i>serve</i>, as he said, <i>two such complete
gentlemen</i>.&nbsp; This was strangely at variance with the
sheep&rsquo;s face he wore, and the name we had just given him.
<a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; Well, I was as firm on my
part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall leave you my wine,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;see to
find me the paper; I want to carry on this correspondence; and,
rely on it, if any one comes without the warning song, I shall
make an end of every suspicious article.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a sheet of paper ready for you; I will give you
more whenever you please, and am perfectly satisfied of your
prudence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I longed to take my coffee; Tremerello left me, and I sat down
to write.&nbsp; Did I do right? was the motive really approved by
God?&nbsp; Was it not rather the triumph of my natural courage,
of my preference of that which pleased me, instead of obeying the
call for painful sacrifices.&nbsp; Mingled with this was a proud
complacency, in return for the esteem expressed towards me by the
unknown, and a fear of appearing cowardly, if I were to adhere to
silence and decline a correspondence, every way so fraught with
peril.&nbsp; How was I to resolve these doubts?&nbsp; I explained
them frankly to my fellow-prisoner in replying to him, stating it
nevertheless, as my opinion, that if anything were undertaken
from good motives, and without the least repugnance of
conscience, there could be no fear of blame.&nbsp; I advised him
at the same time to reflect seriously upon the subject, and to
express clearly with what degree of tranquillity, or of anxiety,
he was prepared to engage, in it.&nbsp; Moreover, if, upon
reconsideration, he considered the plan as too dangerous, we
ought to have firmness enough to renounce the satisfaction we
promised ourselves in such a correspondence, and rest satisfied
with the acquaintance we had formed, the mutual pleasure we had
already derived, and the unalterable goodwill we felt towards
each other, which resulted from it.&nbsp; I filled four pages
with my explanations, and expressions of the warmest friendship;
I briefly alluded to the subject of my imprisonment; I spoke of
my family with enthusiastic love, as well as of some of my
friends, and attempted to draw a full picture of my mind and
character.</p>
<p>In the evening I sent the letter.&nbsp; I had not slept during
the preceding night; I was completely exhausted, and I soon fell
into a profound sleep, from which I awoke on the ensuing morning,
refreshed and comparatively happy.&nbsp; I was in hourly
expectation of receiving my new friend&rsquo;s answer, and I felt
at once anxious and pleased at the idea.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> answer was brought with my
coffee.&nbsp; I welcomed Tremerello, and, embracing him,
exclaimed, &ldquo;May God reward you for this
goodness!&rdquo;&nbsp; My suspicions had fled, because they were
hateful to me; and because, making a point of never speaking
imprudently upon politics, they appeared equally useless; and
because, with all my admiration for the genius of Tacitus, I had
never much faith in the justice of <i>tacitising</i> as he does,
and of looking upon every object on the dark side.&nbsp; Giuliano
(as the writer signed himself), began his letter with the usual
compliments, and informed me that he felt not the least anxiety
in entering upon the correspondence.&nbsp; He rallied me upon my
hesitation; occasionally assumed a tone of irony; and then more
seriously declared that it had given him no little pain to
observe in me &ldquo;a certain scrupulous wavering, and a
subtilty of conscience, which, however Christian-like, was little
in accordance with true philosophy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall
continue to esteem you,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;though we should
not agree upon that point; for I am bound, in all sincerity, to
inform you, that I have no religion, that I abhor all creeds, and
that I assume from a feeling of modesty the name of Julian, from
the circumstance of that good emperor having been so decided an
enemy of the Christians, though, in fact, I go much further than
he ever did.&nbsp; The sceptred Julian believed in God, and had
his own little superstitions.&nbsp; I have none; I believe not in
a God, but refer all virtue to the love of truth, and the hatred
of such as do not please me.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no reasoning
in what he said.&nbsp; He inveighed bitterly against
Christianity, made an idol of worldly honour and virtue; and in a
half serious and jocular vein took on himself to pronounce the
Emperor Julian&rsquo;s eulogium for his apostasy, and his
philanthropic efforts to eradicate all traces of the gospel from
the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Apprehending that he had thus given too severe a shock to my
opinions, he then asked my pardon, attempting to excuse himself
upon the ground of <i>perfect sincerity</i>.&nbsp; Reiterating
his extreme wish to enter into more friendly relations with me,
he then bade me farewell.</p>
<p>In a postscript he added:&mdash;&ldquo;I have no sort of
scruples, except a fear of not having made myself sufficiently
understood.&nbsp; I ought not to conceal that to me the Christian
language which you employ, appears a mere mask to conceal your
real opinions.&nbsp; I wish it may be so; and in this case, throw
off your cloak, as I have set you an example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot describe the effect this letter had upon me.&nbsp; I
had opened it full of hope and ardour.&nbsp; Suddenly an icy hand
seemed to chill the life-blood of my heart.&nbsp; That sarcasm on
my conscientiousness hurt me extremely.&nbsp; I repented having
formed any acquaintance with such a man, I who so much detest the
doctrine of the cynics, who consider it so wholly
unphilosophical, and the most injurious in its tendency: I who
despise all kind of arrogance as it deserves.</p>
<p>Having read the last word it contained, I took the letter in
both my hands, and tearing it directly down the middle, I held up
a half in each like an executioner, employed in exposing it to
public scorn.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">kept</span> my eye fixed on the
fragments, meditating for a moment upon the inconstancy and
fallacy of human things I had just before eagerly desired to
obtain, that which I now tore with disdain.&nbsp; I had hoped to
have found a companion in misfortune, and how I should have
valued his friendship!&nbsp; Now I gave him all kinds of hard
names, insolent, arrogant, atheist, and self-condemned.</p>
<p>I repeated the same operation, dividing the wretched members
of the guilty letter again and again, till happening to cast my
eye on a piece remaining in my hand, expressing some better
sentiment, I changed my intention, and collecting together the
<i>disjecta membra</i>, ingeniously pieced them with the view of
reading it once more.&nbsp; I sat down, placed them on my great
Bible, and examined the whole.&nbsp; I then got up, walked about,
read, and thought, &ldquo;If I do not answer,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;he will think he has terrified me at the mere appearance
of such a philosophical hero, a very Hercules in his own
estimation.&nbsp; Let us show him, with all due courtesy, that we
fear not to confront him and his vicious doctrines, any more than
to brave the risk of a correspondence, more dangerous to others
than to ourselves.&nbsp; I will teach him that true courage does
not consist in ridiculing <i>conscience</i>, and that real
dignity does not consist in arrogance and pride.&nbsp; He shall
be taught the reasonableness of Christianity, and the nothingness
of disbelief.&nbsp; Moreover, if this mock Julian start opinions
so directly opposite to my own, if he spare not the most biting
sarcasm, if he attack me thus uncourteously; is it not all a
proof that he can be no spy?&nbsp; Yet, might not this be a mere
stratagem, to draw me into a discussion by wounding my
self-love?&nbsp; Yet no!&nbsp; I am unjust&mdash;I smart under
his bitter irreligious jests, and conclude at once that he must
be the most infamous of men.&nbsp; Base suspicion, which I have
so often decried in others! he may be what he appears&mdash;a
presumptuous infidel, but not a spy.&nbsp; Have I even a right to
call by the name of <i>insolence</i>, what he considers
<i>sincerity</i>.&nbsp; Is this, I continued, thy humility, oh,
hypocrite?&nbsp; If any one presume to maintain his own opinions,
and to question your faith, he is forthwith to be met with
contempt and abuse.&nbsp; Is not this worse in a Christian, than
the bold sincerity of the unbeliever?&nbsp; Yes, and perhaps he
only requires one ray of Divine grace, to employ his noble
energetic love of truth in the cause of true religion, with far
greater success than yourself.&nbsp; Were it not, then, more
becoming in me to pray for, than to irritate him?&nbsp; Who
knows, but while employed in destroying his letter with every
mark of ignominy, he might be reading mine with expressions of
kindness and affection; never dreaming I should fly into such a
mighty passion at his plain and bold sincerity.&nbsp; Is he not
the better of the two, to love and esteem me while declaring he
is no Christian; than I who exclaim, I am a Christian, and I
detest you.&nbsp; It is difficult to obtain a knowledge of a man
during a long intercourse, yet I would condemn him on the
evidence of a single letter.&nbsp; He may, perhaps, be unhappy in
his atheism, and wish to hear all my arguments to enable him the
better to arrive at the truth.&nbsp; Perhaps, too, I may be
called to effect so beneficent a work, the humble instrument of a
gracious God.&nbsp; Oh, that it may indeed be so, I will not
shrink from the task.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">sat</span> down to write to Julian, and
was cautious not to let one irritating word proceed from my
pen.&nbsp; I took in good part his reflection upon my
fastidiousness of conscience; I even joked about it, telling him
he perhaps gave me too much credit for it, and ought to suspend
his good opinion till he knew me better.&nbsp; I praised his
sincerity, assuring him that he would find me equal to him in
this respect, and that as a proof of it, I had determined to
defend Christianity, &ldquo;Well persuaded,&rdquo; I added,
&ldquo;that as I shall readily give free scope to your opinions,
you will be prepared to give me the same advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then boldly entered upon my task, arguing my way by degrees,
and analysing with impartiality the essence of Christianity; the
worship of God free from superstitions, the brotherhood of
mankind, aspiration after virtue, humility without baseness,
dignity without pride, as exemplified in our Divine Saviour! what
more philosophical, and more truly grand?</p>
<p>It was next my object to demonstrate, &ldquo;that this divine
wisdom had more or less displayed itself to all those who by the
light of reason had sought after the truth, though not generally
diffused till the arrival of its great Author upon the
earth.&nbsp; He had proved his heavenly mission by effecting the
most wonderful and glorious results, by human means the most mean
and humble.&nbsp; What the greatest philosophers had in vain
attempted, the overthrow of idolatry, and the universal preaching
of love and brotherhood, was achieved by a few untutored
missionaries.&nbsp; From that era was first dated the
emancipation of slaves, no less from bondage of limbs than of
mind, until by degrees a civilisation without slavery became
apparent, a state of society believed to be utterly impracticable
by the ancient philosophers.&nbsp; A review of history from the
appearance of Christ to the present age, would finally
demonstrate that the religion he established had invariably been
found adapted to all possible grades in civilised society.&nbsp;
For this reason, the assertion that the gospel was no longer in
accordance with the continued progress of civilisation, could not
for a moment be maintained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wrote in as small characters as I could, and at great
length, but I could not embrace all which I had ready prepared
upon the subject.&nbsp; I re-examined the whole carefully.&nbsp;
There was not one revengeful, injurious, or even repulsive
word.&nbsp; Benevolence, toleration, and forbearance, were the
only weapons I employed against ridicule and sarcasm of every
kind; they were also employed after mature deliberation, and
dictated from the heart.</p>
<p>I despatched the letter, and in no little anxiety waited the
arrival of the next morning, in hopes of a speedy reply.</p>
<p>Tremerello came, and observed; &ldquo;The gentleman, sir, was
not able to write, but entreats of you to continue the
joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The joke!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, he could
not have said that! you must have mistaken him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tremerello shrugged up his shoulders: &ldquo;I suppose I must,
if you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did it really seem as if he had said a
joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As plainly as I now hear the sound of St. Mark&rsquo;s
clock;&rdquo; (the <i>Campanone</i> was just then heard.)&nbsp; I
drank my coffee and was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me; did he read the whole of the
letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he did; for he laughed like a madman, and then
squeezing your letter into a ball, he began to throw it about,
till reminding him that he must not forget to destroy it, he did
so immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then put my coffee cup into Tremerello&rsquo;s hands,
observing that it was plain the coffee had been made by the Siora
Bettina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! is it so bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite vile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; I made it myself; and I can assure you that
I made it strong; there were no dregs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; it may be, my mouth is out of taste.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">walked</span> about the whole morning in
a rage.&nbsp; &ldquo;What an abandoned wretch is this Julian!
what, call my letter a joke! play at ball with it, reply not a
single line!&nbsp; But all your infidels are alike!&nbsp; They
dare not stand the test of argument; they know their weakness,
and try to turn it off with a jest.&nbsp; Full of vanity and
boasting, they venture not to examine even themselves.&nbsp; They
philosophers, indeed! worthy disciples of Democritus; who
<i>did</i> nothing but laugh, and <i>was</i> nothing but a
buffoon.&nbsp; I am rightly served, however, for beginning a
correspondence like this; and still more for writing a second
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At dinner, Tremerello took up my wine, poured it into a flask,
and put it into his pocket, observing: &ldquo;I see that you are
in want of paper;&rdquo; and he gave me some.&nbsp; He retired,
and the moment I cast my eye on the paper, I felt tempted to sit
down and write to Julian a sharp lecture on his intolerable
turpitude and presumption, and so take leave of him.&nbsp; But
again, I repented of my own violence, and uncharitableness, and
finally resolved to write another letter in a better spirit as I
had done before.</p>
<p>I did so, and despatched it without delay.&nbsp; The next
morning I received a few lines, simply expressive of the
writer&rsquo;s thanks; but without a single jest, or the least
invitation to continue the correspondence.&nbsp; Such a billet
displeased me; nevertheless I determined to persevere.&nbsp; Six
long letters were the result, for each of which I received a few
laconic lines of thanks, with some declamation against his
enemies, followed by a joke on the abuse he had heaped upon them,
asserting that it was extremely natural the strong should oppress
the weak, and regretting that he was not in the list of the
former.&nbsp; He then related some of his love affairs, and
observed that they exercised no little sway over his disturbed
imagination.</p>
<p>In reply to my last on the subject of Christianity, he said he
had prepared a long letter; for which I looked out in vain,
though he wrote to me every day on other topics&mdash;chiefly a
tissue of obscenity and folly.</p>
<p>I reminded him of his promise that he would answer all my
arguments, and recommended him to weigh well the reasonings with
which I had supplied him before he attempted to write.&nbsp; He
replied to this somewhat in a rage, assuming the airs of a
philosopher, a man of firmness, a man who stood in no want of
brains to distinguish &ldquo;a hawk from a hand-saw.&rdquo; <a
name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; He then resumed his jocular vein,
and began to enlarge upon his experiences in life, and especially
some very scandalous love adventures.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">bore</span> all this patiently, to give
him no handle for accusing me of bigotry or intolerance, and in
the hope that after the fever of erotic buffoonery and folly had
subsided, he might have some lucid intervals, and listen to
common sense.&nbsp; Meantime I gave him expressly to understand
that I disapproved of his want of respect towards women, his free
and profane expressions, and pitied those unhappy ones, who, he
informed me, had been his victims.</p>
<p>He pretended to care little about my disapprobation, and
repeated: &ldquo;spite of your fine strictures upon immorality, I
know well you are amused with the account of my adventures.&nbsp;
All men are as fond of pleasure as I am, but they have not the
frankness to talk of it without cloaking it from the eyes of the
world; I will go on till you are quite enchanted, and confess
yourself compelled in <i>very conscience</i> to applaud
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he went on from week to week, I bearing with
him, partly out of curiosity and partly in the expectation he
would fall upon some better topic; and I can fairly say that this
species of tolerance, did me no little harm.&nbsp; I began to
lose my respect for pure and noble truths, my thoughts became
confused, and my mind disturbed.&nbsp; To converse with men of
degraded minds is in itself degrading, at least if you possess
not virtue very superior to mine.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a proper
punishment,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for my presumption; this it is
to assume the office of a missionary without its sacredness of
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day I determined to write to him as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;
I have hitherto attempted to turn your attention to other
subjects, and you persevere in sending me accounts of yourself
which no way please me.&nbsp; For the sake of variety, let us
correspond a little respecting worthier matters; if not, give the
hand of fellowship, and let us have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two ensuing days I received no answer, and I was glad of
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, blessed solitude;&rdquo; often I exclaimed,
&ldquo;how far holier and better art thou than harsh and
undignified association with the living.&nbsp; Away with the
empty and impious vanities, the base actions, the low despicable
conversations of such a world.&nbsp; I have studied it enough;
let me turn to my communion with God; to the calm, dear
recollections of my family and my true friends.&nbsp; I will read
my Bible oftener than I have done, I will again write down my
thoughts, will try to raise and improve them, and taste the
pleasure of a sorrow at least innocent; a thousand fold to be
preferred to vulgar and wicked imaginations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whenever Tremerello now entered my room he was in the habit of
saying, &ldquo;I have got no answer yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; was my reply.</p>
<p>About the third day from this, he said, with a serious look,
&ldquo;Signor N. N. is rather indisposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not say, but he has taken to his bed, neither
eats nor drinks, and is sadly out of humour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was touched; he was suffering and had no one to console
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will write him a few lines,&rdquo; exclaimed I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take them this evening, then,&rdquo; said
Tremerello, and he went out.</p>
<p>I was a little perplexed on sitting down to my table:
&ldquo;Am I right in resuming this correspondence?&rdquo; was I
not, just now, praising solitude as a treasure newly found? what
inconsistency is this!&nbsp; Ah! but he neither eats nor drinks,
and I fear must be very ill.&nbsp; Is it, then, a moment to
abandon him?&nbsp; My last letter was severe, and may perhaps
have caused him pain.&nbsp; Perhaps, in spite of our different
ways of thinking, he wished not to end our correspondence.&nbsp;
Yes, he has thought my letter more caustic than I meant it to be,
and taken it in the light of an absolute and contemptuous
dismission.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">sat</span> down and wrote as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear that you are not well, and am extremely sorry
for it.&nbsp; I wish I were with you, and enabled to assist you
as a friend.&nbsp; I hope your illness is the sole cause why you
have not written to me during the last three days.&nbsp; Did you
take offence at my little strictures the other day?&nbsp; Believe
me they were dictated by no ill will or spleen, but with the
single object of drawing your attention to more serious
subjects.&nbsp; Should it be irksome for you to write, send me an
exact account, by word, how you find yourself.&nbsp; You shall
hear from me every day, and I will try to say something to amuse
you, and to show you that I really wish you well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagine my unfeigned surprise when I received an answer,
couched in these terms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I renounce your friendship: if you are at a loss how to
estimate mine, I return the compliment in its full force.&nbsp; I
am not a man to put up with injurious treatment; I am not one,
who, once rejected, will be ordered to return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you heard I was unwell, you approach me with a
hypocritical air, in the idea that illness will break down my
spirit, and make me listen to your sermons . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way he rambled on, reproaching and despising me in the
most revolting terms he could find, and turning every thing I had
said into ridicule and burlesque.&nbsp; He assured me that he
knew how to live and die with consistency; that is to say, with
the utmost hatred and contempt for all philosophical creeds
differing from his own.&nbsp; I was dismayed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty conversion I have made of it!&rdquo; I
exclaimed; &ldquo;yet God is my witness that my motives were
pure.&nbsp; I have done nothing to merit an attack like
this.&nbsp; But patience!&nbsp; I am once more undeceived.&nbsp;
I am not called upon to do more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few days I became less angry, and conceived that all this
bitterness might have resulted from some excitement which might
pass away.&nbsp; Probably he repents, yet scorns to confess he
was in the wrong.&nbsp; In such a state of mind, it might be
generous of me to write to him once more.&nbsp; It cost my
self-love something, but I did it.&nbsp; To humble one&rsquo;s
self for a good purpose is not degrading, with whatever degree of
unjust contempt it may be returned.</p>
<p>I received a reply less violent, but not less insulting.&nbsp;
The implacable patient declared that he admired what he called my
evangelical moderation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, therefore,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;let us resume our correspondence, but let us
speak out.&nbsp; We do not like each other, but we will write,
each for his own amusement, setting everything down which may
come into our heads.&nbsp; You will tell me your seraphic visions
and revelations, and I will treat you with my profane adventures;
you again will run into ecstasies upon the dignity of man, yea,
and of woman; I into an ingenuous narrative of my various
profanations; I hoping to make a convert of you, and you of
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me an answer should you approve these
conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied, &ldquo;Yours is not a compact, but a jest.&nbsp; I
was full of good-will towards you.&nbsp; My conscience does not
constrain me to do more than to wish you every happiness both as
regards this and another life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus ended my secret connexion with that strange man.&nbsp;
But who knows; he was perhaps more exasperated by ill fortune,
delirium, or despair, than really bad at heart.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">once</span> more learnt to value
solitude, and my days tracked each other without any distinction
or mark of change.</p>
<p>The summer was over; it was towards the close of September,
and the heat grew less oppressive; October came.&nbsp; I
congratulated myself now on occupying a chamber well adapted for
winter.&nbsp; One morning, however, the jailer made his
appearance, with an order to change my prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where am I to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few steps, into a fresher chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not think of it when I was dying of
suffocation; when the air was filled with gnats, and my bed with
bugs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The order did not come before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience! let us be gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding I had suffered so greatly in this prison, it
gave me pain to leave it; not simply because it would have been
best for the winter season, but for many other reasons.&nbsp;
There I had the ants to attract my attention, which I had fed and
looked upon, I may almost say, with paternal care.&nbsp; Within
the last few days, however, my friend the spider, and my great
ally in my war with the gnats, had, for some reason or other,
chosen to emigrate; at least he did not come as usual.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yet perhaps,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he may remember me, and
come back, but he will find my prison empty, or occupied by some
other guest&mdash;no friend perhaps to spiders&mdash;and thus
meet with an awkward reception.&nbsp; His fine woven house, and
his gnat-feasts will all be put an end to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, my gloomy abode had been embellished by the presence of
Angiola, so good, so gentle and compassionate.&nbsp; There she
used to sit, and try every means she could devise to amuse me,
even dropping crumbs of bread for my little visitors, the ants;
and there I heard her sobs, and saw the tears fall thick and
fast, as she spoke of her cruel lover.</p>
<p>The place I was removed to was under the leaden prisons, (<i>I
Piombi</i>) open to the north and west, with two windows, one on
each side; an abode exposed to perpetual cold and even icy chill
during the severest months.&nbsp; The window to the west was the
largest, that to the north was high and narrow, and situated
above my bed.</p>
<p>I first looked out at this last, and found that it commanded a
view of the Palace of the Patriarch.&nbsp; Other prisons were
near mine, in a narrow wing to the right, and in a projection of
the building right opposite.&nbsp; Here were two prisons, one
above the other.&nbsp; The lower had an enormous window, through
which I could see a man, very richly drest, pacing to and
fro.&nbsp; It was the Signor Caporale di Cesena.&nbsp; He
perceived me, made a signal, and we pronounced each other&rsquo;s
names.</p>
<p>I next looked out at my other window.&nbsp; I put the little
table upon my bed, and a chair upon my table; I climbed up and
found myself on a level with part of the palace roof; and beyond
this was to be seen a fine view of the city and the lake.</p>
<p>I paused to admire it; and though I heard some one open the
door, I did not move.&nbsp; It was the jailer; and perceiving
that I had clambered up, he got it into his head I was making an
attempt to escape, forgetting, in his alarm, that I was not a
mouse to creep through all those narrow bars.&nbsp; In a moment
he sprung upon the bed, spite of a violent sciatica which had
nearly bent him double, and catching me by the legs, he began to
call out, &ldquo;thieves and murder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;you
thoughtless man, that I cannot conjure myself through these
horrible bars?&nbsp; Surely you know I got up here out of mere
curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I see, I apprehend, sir; but quick, sir, jump
down, sir; these are all temptations of the devil to make you
think of it! come down, sir, pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lost no time in my descent, and laughed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the windows of the side prisons
I recognised six other prisoners, all there on account of
politics.&nbsp; Just then, as I was composing my mind to perfect
solitude, I found myself comparatively in a little world of human
beings around me.&nbsp; The change was, at first, irksome to me,
such complete seclusion having rendered me almost unsociable, add
to which, the disagreeable termination of my correspondence with
Julian.&nbsp; Still, the little conversation I was enabled to
carry on, partly by signs, with my new fellow-prisoners, was of
advantage by diverting my attention.&nbsp; I breathed not a word
respecting my correspondence with Julian; it was a point of
honour between us, and in bringing it forward here, I was fully
aware that in the immense number of unhappy men with which these
prisons were thronged, it would be impossible to ascertain who
was the assumed Julian.</p>
<p>To the interest derived from seeing my fellow-captives was
added another of a yet more delightful kind.&nbsp; I could
perceive from my large window, beyond the projection of prisons,
situated right before me, a surface of roofs; decorated with
cupolas, <i>campanili</i>, towers, and chimneys, which gradually
faded in a distant view of sea and sky.&nbsp; In the house
nearest to me, a wing of the Patriarchal palace, lived an
excellent family, who had a claim to my gratitude, for
expressing, by their salutations, the interest which they took in
my fate.&nbsp; A sign, a word of kindness to the unhappy, is
really charity of no trivial kind.&nbsp; From one of the windows
I saw a little boy, nine or ten years old, stretching out his
hands towards me, and I heard him call out, &ldquo;Mamma, mamma,
they have placed somebody up there in the Piombi.&nbsp; Oh, you
poor prisoner, who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Silvio Pellico,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>Another older boy now ran to the same window, and cried out,
&ldquo;Are you Silvio Pellico?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and tell me your names, dear boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Antonio S&mdash;, and my brother&rsquo;s is
Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then turned round, and, speaking to some one within,
&ldquo;What else ought I to ask him?&rdquo;&nbsp; A lady, whom I
conjecture to have been their mother, then half concealed,
suggested some pretty words to them, which they repeated, and for
which I thanked them with all my heart.&nbsp; These sort of
communications were a small matter, yet it required to be
cautious how we indulged in them, lest we should attract the
notice of the jailer.&nbsp; Morning, noon, and night, they were a
source of the greatest consolation; the little boys were
constantly in the habit of bidding me good night, before the
windows were closed, and the lights brought in, &ldquo;Good
night, Silvio,&rdquo; and often it was repeated by the good lady,
in a more subdued voice, &ldquo;Good night, Silvio, have
courage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When engaged at their meals they would say, &ldquo;How we wish
we could give you any of this good coffee and milk.&nbsp; Pray
remember, the first day they let you out, to come and see
us.&nbsp; Mamma and we will give you plenty of good things, <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a> and as many kisses as you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> month of October brought round
one of the most disagreeable anniversaries in my life.&nbsp; I
was arrested on the 13th of that month in the preceding
year.&nbsp; Other recollections of the same period, also pained
me.&nbsp; That day two years, a highly valued and excellent man
whom I truly honoured, was drowned in the Ticino.&nbsp; Three
years before, a young person, Odoardo Briche, <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a> whom I loved as if he had been my own
son, had accidentally killed himself with a musket.&nbsp; Earlier
in my youth another severe affliction had befallen me in the same
month.</p>
<p>Though not superstitious, the remembrance of so many unhappy
occurrences at the same period of the year, inspired a feeling of
extreme sorrow.&nbsp; While conversing at the window with the
children, and with my fellow prisoners, I assumed an air of
mirth, but hardly had I re-entered my cave than an irresistible
feeling of melancholy weighed down every faculty of my
mind.&nbsp; In vain I attempted to engage in some literary
composition; I was involuntarily impelled to write upon other
topics.&nbsp; I thought of my family, and wrote letters after
letters, in which I poured forth all my burdened spirit, all I
had felt and enjoyed of home, in far happier days, surrounded by
brothers, sisters, and friends who had always loved me.&nbsp; The
desire of seeing them, and long compulsory separation, led me to
speak on a variety of little things, and reveal a thousand
thoughts of gratitude and tenderness, which would not otherwise
have occurred to my mind.</p>
<p>In the same way I took a review of my former life, diverting
my attention by recalling past incidents, and dwelling upon those
happier periods now for ever fled.&nbsp; Often, when the picture
I had thus drawn, and sat contemplating for hours, suddenly
vanished from my sight, and left me conscious only of the fearful
present, and more threatening future, the pen fell from my hand;
I recoiled with horror; the contrast was more than I could
bear.&nbsp; These were terrific moments; I had already felt them,
but never with such intense susceptibility as then.&nbsp; It was
agony.&nbsp; This I attributed to extreme excitement of the
passions, occasioned by expressing them in the form of letters,
addressed to persons to whom I was so tenderly attached.</p>
<p>I turned to other subjects, I determined to change the form of
expressing my ideas, but could not.&nbsp; In whatever way I
began, it always ended in a letter teeming with affection and
with grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;am I no more master of
my own will?&nbsp; Is this strange necessity of doing that which
I object to, a distortion of my brain?&nbsp; At first I could
have accounted for it; but after being inured to this solitude,
reconciled, and supported by religious reflections; how have I
become the slave of these blind impulses, these wanderings of
heart and mind? let me apply to other matters!&rdquo;&nbsp; I
then endeavoured to pray; or to weary my attention by hard study
of the German.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I commenced and found myself
actually engaged in writing a letter!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> a state of mind was a real
disease, or I know not if it may be called a kind of
somnambulism.&nbsp; Without doubt it was the effect of extreme
lassitude, occasioned by continual thought and watchfulness.</p>
<p>It gained upon me.&nbsp; I grew feverish and sleepless.&nbsp;
I left off coffee, but the disease was not removed.&nbsp; It
appeared to me as if I were two persons, one of them eagerly bent
upon writing letters, the other upon doing something else.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you shall write them in
German if you do; and we shall learn a little of the
language.&rdquo;&nbsp; Methought <i>he</i> then set to work, and
wrote volumes of bad German, and he certainly brought me rapidly
forward in the study of it.&nbsp; Towards morning, my mind being
wholly exhausted, I fell into a heavy stupor, during which all
those most dear to me haunted my dreams.&nbsp; I thought that my
father and mother were weeping over me; I heard their
lamentations, and suddenly I started out of my sleep sobbing and
affrighted.&nbsp; Sometimes, during short, disturbed slumbers, I
heard my mother&rsquo;s voice, as if consoling others, with whom
she came into my prison, and she addressed me in the most
affectionate language upon the duty of resignation, and then,
when I was rejoiced to see her courage, and that of others,
suddenly she appeared to burst into tears, and all wept.&nbsp; I
can convey no idea of the species of agony which I at these times
felt.</p>
<p>To escape from this misery, I no longer went to bed.&nbsp; I
sat down to read by the light of my lamp, but I could comprehend
nothing, and soon I found that I was even unable to think.&nbsp;
I next tried to copy something, but still copied something
different from what I was writing, always recurring to the
subject of my afflictions.&nbsp; If I retired to rest, it was
worse; I could lie in no position; I became convulsed, and was
constrained to rise.&nbsp; In case I slept, the same visions
reappeared, and made me suffer much more than I did by keeping
awake.&nbsp; My prayers, too, were feeble and ineffectual; and,
at length, I could simply invoke the name of the Deity; of the
Being who had assumed a human form, and was acquainted with
grief.&nbsp; I was afraid to sleep; my prayers seemed to bring me
no relief; my imagination became excited, and, even when awake, I
heard strange noises close to me, sometimes sighs and groans, at
others mingled with sounds of stifled laughter.&nbsp; I was never
superstitious, but these apparently real and unaccountable sights
and sounds led me to doubt, and I then firmly believed that I was
the victim of some unknown and malignant beings.&nbsp; Frequently
I took my light, and made a search for those mockers and
persecutors of my waking and sleeping hours.&nbsp; At last they
began to pull me by my clothes, threw my books upon the ground,
blew out my lamp, and even, as it seemed, conveyed me into
another dungeon.&nbsp; I would then start to my feet, look and
examine all round me, and ask myself if I were really mad.&nbsp;
The actual world, and that of my imagination, were no longer
distinguishable, I knew not whether what I saw and felt was a
delusion or truth.&nbsp; In this horrible state I could only
repeat one prayer, &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
me?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning early, I threw myself
upon my pallet, having first placed my handkerchief, as usual,
under my pillow.&nbsp; Shortly after, falling asleep, I suddenly
woke, and found myself in a state of suffocation; my persecutors
were strangling me, and, on putting my hand to my throat, I
actually found my own handkerchief, all knotted, tied round my
neck.&nbsp; I could have sworn I had never made those knots; yet
I must have done this in my delirium; but as it was then
impossible to believe it, I lived in continual expectation of
being strangled.&nbsp; The recollection is still horrible.&nbsp;
They left me at dawn of day; and, resuming my courage, I no
longer felt the least apprehension, and even imagined it would be
impossible they should again return.&nbsp; Yet no sooner did the
night set in, than I was again haunted by them in all their
horrors; being made sensible of their gradual approach by cold
shiverings, the loss of all power, with a species of fascination
which riveted both the eye and the mind.&nbsp; In fact, the more
weak and wretched I felt, at night, the greater were my efforts
during the day to appear cheerful in conversing with my
companions, with the two boys at the palace, and with my
jailers.&nbsp; No one to hear my jokes, would have imagined it
possible that I was suffering under the disease I did.&nbsp; I
thought to encourage myself by this forced merriment, but the
spectral visions which I laughed at by day became fearful
realities in the hours of darkness.</p>
<p>Had I dared, I should have petitioned the commission to change
my apartment, but the fear of ridicule, in case I should be asked
my reasons, restrained me.&nbsp; No reasonings, no studies, or
pursuits, and even no prayers, were longer of avail, and the idea
of being wholly abandoned by heaven, took possession of my
mind.</p>
<p>All those wicked sophisms against a just Providence, which,
while in possession of reason, had appeared to me so vain and
impious, now recurred with redoubled power, in the form of
irresistible arguments.&nbsp; I struggled mightily against this
last and greatest evil I had yet borne, and in the lapse of a few
days the temptation fled.&nbsp; Still I refused to acknowledge
the truth and beauty of religion; I quoted the assertions of the
most violent atheists, and those which Julian had so recently
dwelt upon: &ldquo;Religion serves only to enfeeble the
mind,&rdquo; was one of these, and I actually presumed that by
renouncing my God I should acquire greater fortitude.&nbsp;
Insane idea!&nbsp; I denied God, yet knew not how to deny those
invisible malevolent beings, that appeared to encompass me, and
feast upon my sufferings.</p>
<p>What shall I call this martyrdom? is it enough to say that it
was a disease? or was it a divine chastisement for my pride, to
teach me that without a special illumination I might become as
great an unbeliever as Julian, and still more absurd.&nbsp;
However this may be, it pleased God to deliver me from such evil,
when I least expected it.&nbsp; One morning, after taking my
coffee, I was seized with violent sickness, attended with
colic.&nbsp; I imagined that I had been poisoned.&nbsp; After
excessive vomiting, I burst into a strong perspiration and
retired to bed.&nbsp; About mid-day I fell asleep, and continued
in a quiet slumber till evening.&nbsp; I awoke in great surprise
at this unexpected repose, and, thinking I should not sleep
again, I got up.&nbsp; On rising I said, &ldquo;I shall now have
more fortitude to resist my accustomed terrors.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
they returned no more.&nbsp; I was in ecstasies; I threw myself
upon my knees in the fulness of my heart, and again prayed to my
God in spirit and in truth, beseeching pardon for having denied,
during many days, His holy name.&nbsp; It was almost too much for
my newly reviving strength, and while even yet upon my knees,
supporting my head against a chair, I fell into a profound sleep
in that very position.</p>
<p>Some hours afterwards, as I conjectured, I seemed in part to
awake, but no sooner had I stretched my weary limbs upon my rude
couch than I slept till the dawn of day.&nbsp; The same
disposition to somnolency continued through the day, and the next
night, I rested as soundly as before.&nbsp; What was the sort of
crisis that had thus taken place?&nbsp; I know not; but I was
perfectly restored.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sickness of the stomach which I
had so long laboured under now ceased, the pains of the head also
left me, and I felt an extraordinary appetite.&nbsp; My digestion
was good, and I gained strength.&nbsp; Wonderful providence! that
deprived me of my health to humble my mind, and again restored it
when the moment was at hand that I should require it all, that I
might not sink under the weight of my sentence.</p>
<p>On the 24th of November, one of our companions, Dr. Foresti,
was taken from the <i>Piombi</i>, and transported no one knew
whither.&nbsp; The jailer, his wife, and the assistants, were
alike alarmed, and not one of them ventured to throw the least
light upon this mysterious affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should you persist,&rdquo; said Tremerello,
&ldquo;in wishing to know, when nothing good is to be
heard?&nbsp; I have told you too much&mdash;too much
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is the use of trying to hide it?&nbsp; I know
it too well.&nbsp; He is condemned to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? . . . he . . . Doctor Foresti?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tremerello hesitated, but the love of gossip was not the least
of his virtues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say, then,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;that I
am a babbler; I never wished to say a word about these matters;
so, remember, it is you who compel me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I do compel you; but courage! tell me every
thing you know respecting the poor Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Sir! they have made him cross the Bridge of Sighs!
he lies in the dungeons of the condemned; sentence of death has
been announced to him and two others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will it be executed?&nbsp; When?&nbsp; Oh, unhappy
man! and what are the others&rsquo; names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know no more.&nbsp; The sentences have not been
published.&nbsp; It is reported in Venice that they will be
commuted.&nbsp; I trust in God they may, at least, as regards the
good Doctor.&nbsp; Do you know, I am as fond of that noble
fellow, pardon the expression, as if he were my own
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed moved, and walked away.&nbsp; Imagine the agitation
I suffered throughout the whole of that day, and indeed long
after, as there were no means of ascertaining anything further
respecting the fate of these unfortunate men.</p>
<p>A month elapsed, and at length the sentences connected with
the first trial were published.&nbsp; Nine were condemned to
death, <i>graciously</i> exchanged for hard imprisonment, some
for twenty, and others for fifteen years in the fortress of
Spielberg, near the city of Brunn, in Moravia; while those for
ten years and under were to be sent to the fortress of
Lubiana.</p>
<p>Were we authorised to conclude, from this commutation of
sentence in regard to those first condemned, that the parties
subject to the second trial would likewise be spared?&nbsp; Was
the indulgence to be confined only to the former, on account of
their having been arrested previous to the publication of the
edicts against secret societies; the full vengeance of the law
being reserved for subsequent offenders?</p>
<p>Well, I exclaimed, we shall not long be kept in suspense; I am
at least grateful to Heaven for being allowed time to prepare
myself in a becoming manner for the final scene.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was now my only consideration
how to die like a Christian, and with proper fortitude.&nbsp; I
felt, indeed, a strong temptation to avoid the scaffold by
committing suicide, but overcame it.&nbsp; What merit is there in
refusing to die by the hand of the executioner, and yet to fall
by one&rsquo;s own?&nbsp; To save one&rsquo;s honour?&nbsp; But
is it not childish to suppose that there can be more honour in
cheating the executioner, than in not doing this, when it is
clear that we must die.&nbsp; Even had I not been a Christian,
upon serious reflection, suicide would have appeared to me both
ridiculous and useless, if not criminal in a high degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the term of life be expired,&rdquo; continued I,
&ldquo;am I not fortunate in being permitted to collect my
thoughts and purify my conscience with penitence and prayer
becoming a man in affliction.&nbsp; In popular estimation, the
being led to the scaffold is the worst part of death; in the
opinion of the wise, is not this far preferable to the thousand
deaths which daily occur by disease, attended by general
prostration of intellect, without power to raise the thoughts
from the lowest state of physical exhaustion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt the justice of this reasoning, and lost all feeling of
anxiety or terror at the idea of a public execution.&nbsp; I
reflected deeply on the sacraments calculated to support me under
such an appalling trial, and I felt disposed to receive them in a
right spirit.&nbsp; Should I have been enabled, had I really been
conducted to the scaffold, to preserve the same elevation of
mind, the same forgiveness of my enemies, the same readiness to
lay down my life at the will of God, as I then felt?&nbsp; Alas,
how inconsistent is man! when most firm and pious, how liable is
he to fall suddenly into weakness and crime!&nbsp; Is it likely I
should have died worthily?&nbsp; God only knows; I dare not think
well enough of myself to assert it.</p>
<p>The probable approach of death so riveted my imagination, that
not only did it seem possible but as if marked by an infallible
presentiment.&nbsp; I no longer indulged a hope of avoiding it,
and at every sound of footsteps and keys, or the opening of my
door, I was in the habit of exclaiming: &ldquo;Courage!&nbsp;
Perhaps I am going to receive sentence.&nbsp; Let me hear it with
calm dignity, and bless the name of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I considered in what terms I should last address my family,
each of my brothers, and each of my sisters, and by revolving in
my mind these sacred and affecting duties, I was often drowned in
tears, without losing my fortitude and resignation.</p>
<p>I was naturally unable to enjoy sound repose; but my
sleeplessness was not of the same alarming character as before;
no visions, spectres, or concealed enemies were ready to deprive
me of life.&nbsp; I spent the night in calm and reviving
prayer.&nbsp; Towards morning I was enabled to sleep for about
two hours, and rose late to breakfast.</p>
<p>One night I had retired to rest earlier than usual; I had
hardly slept a quarter of an hour, when I awoke, and beheld an
immense light upon the wall opposite to me.&nbsp; At first I
imagined that I had been seized with my former illness; but this
was no illusion.&nbsp; The light shone through the north window,
under which I then lay.</p>
<p>I started up, seized my table, placed it on my bed, and a
chair again upon the table, by means of all which I mounted up,
and beheld one of the most terrific spectacles of fire that can
be imagined.&nbsp; It was not more than a musket shot distant
from our prison; it proceeded from the establishment of the
public ovens, and the edifice was entirely consumed.</p>
<p>The night was exceedingly dark, and vast globes of flame
spouted forth on both sides, borne away by a violent wind.&nbsp;
All around, it seemed as if the sky rained sparks of fire.&nbsp;
The adjacent lake reflected the magnificent sight; numbers of
gondolas went and came, but my sympathy was most excited at the
danger and terrors of those who resided nearest to the burning
edifice.&nbsp; I heard the far off voices of men and women
calling to each other.&nbsp; Among others, I caught the name of
Angiola, and of this doubtless there are some thousands in
Venice: yet I could not help fearing it might be the one of whom
the recollection was so sweet to me.&nbsp; Could it be
her?&mdash;was she surrounded by the flames? how I longed to fly
to her rescue.</p>
<p>Full of excitement, wonder, and terror, I stood at the window
till the day dawned, I then got down oppressed by a feeling of
deep sorrow, and imagined much greater misfortune than had really
occurred.&nbsp; I was informed by Tremerello that only the ovens
and the adjoining magazine had suffered, the loss consisting
chiefly of corn and sacks of flour.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> effect of this accident upon my
imagination had not yet ceased, when one night, as I was sitting
at my little table reading, and half perished with cold, I heard
a number of voices not far from me.&nbsp; They were those of the
jailer, his wife, and sons, with the assistants, all crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! fire.&nbsp; Oh, blessed Virgin! we are lost, we
are lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt no longer cold, I started to my feet in a violent
perspiration, and looked out to discover the quarter from which
the fire proceeded.&nbsp; I could perceive nothing, I was
informed, however, that it arose in the palace itself, from some
public chambers contiguous to the prisons.&nbsp; One of the
assistants called out, &ldquo;But, sir governor, what shall we do
with these caged birds here, if the fire keeps a
head?&rdquo;&nbsp; The head jailer replied, &ldquo;Why, I should
not like to have them roasted alive.&nbsp; Yet I cannot let them
out of their bars without special orders from the
commission.&nbsp; You may run as fast as you can, and get an
order if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I will, but, you know, it will be too late
for the prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was said in the rude Venetian dialect, but I
understood it too well.&nbsp; And now, where was all my heroic
spirit and resignation, which I had counted upon to meet sudden
death?&nbsp; Why did the idea of being burnt alive throw me into
such a fever?&nbsp; I felt ashamed of this unworthy fear, and
though just on the point of crying out to the jailer to let me
out, I restrained myself, reflecting that there might be as
little pleasure in being strangled as in being burnt.&nbsp; Still
I felt really afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is a specimen of my
courage, should I escape the flames, and be doomed to mount the
scaffold.&nbsp; I will restrain my fear, and hide it from others
as well as I can, though I know I shall tremble.&nbsp; Yet surely
it is courage to behave as if we were not afraid, whatever we may
feel.&nbsp; Is it not generosity to give away that which it costs
us much to part with?&nbsp; It is, also, an act of obedience,
though we obey with great repugnance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tumult in the jailer&rsquo;s house was so loud and
continued that I concluded the fire was on the increase.&nbsp;
The messenger sent to ask permission for our temporary release
had not returned.&nbsp; At last I thought I heard his voice; no;
I listened, he is not come.&nbsp; Probably the permission will
not be granted; there will be no means of escape; if the jailer
should not humanely take the responsibility upon himself, we
shall be suffocated in our dungeons!&nbsp; Well, but this, I
exclaimed, is not philosophy, and it is not religion.&nbsp; Were
it not better to prepare myself to witness the flames bursting
into my chamber, and about to swallow me up.</p>
<p>Meantime the clamour seemed to diminish; by degrees it died
away; was this any proof that the fire had ceased?&nbsp; Or,
perhaps, all who could had already fled, and left the prisoners
to their fate.</p>
<p>The silence continued, no flames appeared, and I retired to
bed, reproaching myself for the want of fortitude I had
evinced.&nbsp; Indeed, I began to regret that I had not been
burnt alive, instead of being handed over, as a victim, into the
hands of men.</p>
<p>The next morning, I learnt the real cause of the fire from
Tremerello, and laughed at his account of the fear he had
endured, as if my own had not been as great&mdash;perhaps, in
fact, much greater of the two.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER L.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 11th of January, 1822, about
nine in the morning, Tremerello came into my room in no little
agitation, and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Sir, that in the island of San Michele, a
little way from Venice, there is a prison containing more than a
hundred Carbonari.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have told me so a hundred times.&nbsp; Well! what
would you have me hear, speak out; are some of them
condemned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my poor friend Maroncelli among them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Sir, too many . . . I know not who.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he went away in great emotion, casting on me a look of
compassion.</p>
<p>Shortly after came the jailer, attended by the assistants, and
by a man whom I had never before seen.&nbsp; The latter opened
his subject as follows: &ldquo;The commission, Sir, has given
orders that you come with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go, then,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;may I ask who
you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am jailer of the San Michele prisons, where I am
going to take you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jailer of the <i>Piombi</i> delivered to the new governor
the money belonging to me which he had in his hands.&nbsp; I
obtained permission to make some little present to the under
jailers; I then put my clothes in order, put my Bible under my
arm, and departed.&nbsp; In descending the immense track of
staircases, Tremerello for a moment took my hand; he pressed it
as much as to say, &ldquo;Unhappy man! you are lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We came out at a gate which opened upon the lake, and there
stood a gondola with two under jailers belonging to San
Michele.</p>
<p>I entered the boat with feelings of the most contradictory
nature; regret at leaving the prison of the <i>Piombi</i>, where
I had suffered so much, but where I had become attached to some
individuals, and they to me; the pleasure of beholding once more
the sky, the city, and the clear waters, without the intervention
of iron bars.&nbsp; Add to this the recollection of that joyous
gondola, which, in time past, had borne me on the bosom of that
placid lake; the gondolas of the lake of Como, those of Lago
Maggiore, the little barks of the Po, those of the Rodano, and of
the Sonna!&nbsp; Oh, happy vanished years! who, who then so happy
in the world as I?</p>
<p>The son of excellent and affectionate parents, in a rank of
life, perhaps, the happiest for the cultivation of the
affections, being equally removed from riches and from poverty; I
had spent my infancy in the participation of the sweetest
domestic ties; had been the object of the tenderest domestic
cares.&nbsp; I had subsequently gone to Lyons, to my maternal
uncle, an elderly man, extremely wealthy, and deserving of all he
possessed; and at his mansion I partook of all the advantages and
delights of elegance and refined society, which gave an
indescribable charm to those youthful days.&nbsp; Thence
returning into Italy, under the parental roof, I at once devoted
myself with ardour to study, and the enjoyment of society;
everywhere meeting with distinguished friends and the most
encouraging praise.&nbsp; Monti and Foscolo, although at variance
with each other, were kind to me.&nbsp; I became more attached to
the latter, and this irritable man, who, by his asperities,
provoked so many to quarrel with him, was with me full of
gentleness and cordiality.&nbsp; Other distinguished characters
likewise became attached to me, and I returned all their
regard.&nbsp; Neither envy nor calumny had the least influence
over me, or I felt it only from persons who had not the power to
injure me.&nbsp; On the fall of the kingdom of Italy, my father
removed to Turin, with the rest of his family.&nbsp; I had
preferred to remain at Milan, where I spent my time at once so
profitably and so happily as made me unwilling to leave it.&nbsp;
Here I had three friends to whom I was greatly attached&mdash;D.
Pietro Borsieri, Lodovico di Breme, and the Count Luigi Porro
Lambertenghi.&nbsp; Subsequently I added to them Count Federigo
Confalonieri. <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; Becoming the preceptor of two
young sons of Count Porro, I was to them as a father, and their
father acted like a brother to me.&nbsp; His mansion was the
resort not only of society the most refined and cultivated of
Italy, but of numbers of celebrated strangers.&nbsp; It was there
I became acquainted with De Stael, Schlegel, Davis, Byron,
Brougham, Hobhouse, and illustrious travellers from all parts of
Europe.&nbsp; How delightful, how noble an incentive to all that
is great and good, is an intercourse with men of first-rate
merit!&nbsp; I was then happy; I would not have exchanged my lot
with a prince; and now, to be hurled, as I had been, from the
summit of all my hopes and projects, into an abyss of
wretchedness, and to be hurried thus from dungeon to dungeon, to
perish doubtless either by a violent death or lingering in
chains.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Absorbed</span> in reflections like these,
I reached San Michele, and was locked up in a room which embraced
a view of the court yard, of the lake, and the beautiful island
of Murano.&nbsp; I inquired respecting Maroncelli from the
jailer, from his wife, and the four assistants; but their visits
were exceedingly brief, very ceremonious, and, in fact, they
would tell me nothing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless where there are five or six persons, it is rarely
you do not find one who possesses a compassionate, as well as a
communicative disposition.&nbsp; I met with such a one, and from
him I learnt what follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Maroncelli, after having been long kept apart, had been placed
with Count Camillo Laderchi. <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a>&nbsp; The last,
within a few days, had been declared innocent, and discharged
from prison, and the former again remained alone.&nbsp; Some
other of our companions had also been set at liberty; the
Professor Romagnosi, <a name="citation21"></a><a
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a> and Count Giovanni
Arrivabene. <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a>&nbsp; Captain Rezia <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a> and the Signor Canova were
together.&nbsp; Professor Ressi <a name="citation24"></a><a
href="#footnote24" class="citation">[24]</a> was dying at that
time, in a prison next to that of the two before mentioned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It follows then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the sentences
of those not set at liberty must have arrived.&nbsp; How are they
to be made known?&nbsp; Perhaps, poor Ressi will die; and will
not be in a state to hear his sentence; is it true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every day I inquired respecting the unhappy man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He has lost his voice; he is rather better; he is
delirious; he is nearly gone; he spits blood; he is dying;&rdquo;
were the usual replies; till at length came the last of all,
&ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shed a tear to his memory, and consoled myself with thinking
that he died ignorant of the sentence which awaited him.</p>
<p>The day following, the 21st of February, 1822, the jailer came
for me about ten o&rsquo;clock, and conducted me into the Hall of
the Commission.&nbsp; The members were all seated, but they rose;
the President, the Inquisitor, and two assisting
Judges.&mdash;The first, with a look of deep commiseration,
acquainted me that my sentence had arrived; that it was a
terrible one; but that the clemency of the Emperor had mitigated
it.</p>
<p>The Inquisitor, fixing his eye on me, then read
it:&mdash;&ldquo;Silvio Pellico, condemned to death; the imperial
decree is, that the sentence be commuted for fifteen years hard
imprisonment in the fortress of Spielberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will of God be done!&rdquo; was my reply.</p>
<p>It was really my intention to bear this horrible blow like a
Christian, and neither to exhibit nor to feel resentment against
any one whatever.&nbsp; The President then commended my state of
mind, warmly recommending me to persevere in it, and that
possibly by affording an edifying example, I might in a year or
two be deemed worthy of receiving further favours from the
imperial clemency.</p>
<p>Instead, however, of one or two, it was many years before the
full sentence was remitted.</p>
<p>The other judges also spoke encouragingly to me.&nbsp; One of
them, indeed, had appeared my enemy on my trial, accosting me in
a courteous but ironical tone, while his look of insulting
triumph seemed to belie his words.&nbsp; I would not make oath it
was so, but my blood was then boiling, and I was trying to
smother my passion.&nbsp; While they were praising me for my
Christian patience, I had not a jot of it left me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; continued the Inquisitor, &ldquo;I am
sorry to say, you must appear and receive your sentence in
public.&nbsp; It is a formality which cannot be dispensed
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so!&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this time we grant you the company of your
friend,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; Then calling the jailer, he
consigned me into his hands, ordering that I should be placed in
the same dungeon with Maroncelli.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a delightful moment, when,
after a separation of three months, and having suffered so
greatly, I met my friend.&nbsp; For some moments we forgot even
the severity of our sentence, conscious only of each
other&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>But I soon turned from my friend to perform a more serious
duty&mdash;that of writing to my father.&nbsp; I was desirous
that the first tidings of my sad lot should reach my family from
myself; in order that the grief which I knew they would all feel
might be at least mitigated by hearing my state of mind, and the
sentiments of peace and religion by which I was supported.&nbsp;
The judges had given me a promise to expedite the letter the
moment it was written.</p>
<p>Maroncelli next spoke to me respecting his trial; I acquainted
him with mine, and we mutually described our prison walks and
adventures, complimenting each other on our peripatetic
philosophy.&nbsp; We approached our window, and saluted three of
our friends, whom we beheld standing at theirs.&nbsp; Two of
these were Canova and Rezia, in the same apartment; the first of
whom was condemned to six-years&rsquo; hard imprisonment, and the
last to three.&nbsp; The third was Doctor Cesare Armari, who had
been my neighbour some preceding months, in the prisons of the
Piombi.&nbsp; He was not, however, among the condemned, and soon
obtained his liberty.</p>
<p>The power of communicating with one or other of our
fellow-prisoners, at all hours, was a great relief to our
feelings.&nbsp; But when buried in silence and darkness, I was
unable to compose myself to rest; I felt my head burn, and my
heart bleed, as my thoughts reverted to home.&nbsp; Would my aged
parents be enabled to bear up against so heavy a misfortune?
would they find a sufficient resource in their other
children?&nbsp; They were equally attached to all, and I valued
myself least of all in that family of love; but will a father and
a mother ever find in the children that remain to them a
compensation for the one of whom they are deprived.</p>
<p>Had I dwelt only upon my relatives and a few other dear
friends, much as I regretted them, my thoughts would have been
less bitter than they were.&nbsp; But I thought of the insulting
smile of that judge, of the trial, the cause of the respective
sentences, political passions and enmities, and the fate of so
many of my friends . . . It was then I could no longer think with
patience or indulgence of any of my persecutors.&nbsp; God had
subjected me to a severe trial, and it was my duty to have borne
it with courage.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I was neither able nor
willing.&nbsp; The pride and luxury of hatred pleased me better
than the noble spirit of forgiveness; and I passed a night of
horror after receiving sentence.</p>
<p>In the morning I could not pray.&nbsp; The universe appeared
to me, then, to be the work of some power, the enemy of
good.&nbsp; I had previously, indeed, been guilty of calumniating
my Creator; but little did I imagine I should revert to such
ingratitude, and in so brief a time.&nbsp; Julian, in his most
impious moods, could not express himself more impiously than
myself.&nbsp; To gloat over thoughts of hatred, or fierce
revenge, when smarting under the scourge of heaviest calamity,
instead of flying to religion as a refuge, renders a man
criminal, even though his cause be just.&nbsp; If we hate, it is
a proof of rank pride; and where is the wretched mortal that dare
stand up and declare in the face of Heaven, his title to hatred
and revenge against his fellows? to assert that none have a right
to sit in judgment upon him and his actions;&mdash;that none can
injure him without a bad intention, or a violation of all
justice?&nbsp; In short, he dares to arraign the decrees of
Heaven itself, if it please Providence to make him suffer in a
manner which he does not himself approve.</p>
<p>Still I was unhappy because I could not pray; for when pride
reigns supreme, it acknowledges no other god than the self-idol
it has created.&nbsp; How I could have wished to recommend to the
Supreme Protector, the care of my bereaved parents, though at
that unhappy moment I felt as if I no more believed in Him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> nine in the morning Maroncelli
and I were conducted into the gondola which conveyed us into the
city.&nbsp; We alighted at the palace of the Doge, and proceeded
to the prisons.&nbsp; We were placed in the apartment which had
been occupied by Signor Caporali a few days before, but with
whose fate we were not acquainted.&nbsp; Nine or ten sbirri were
placed over us as a guard, and walking about, we awaited the
moment of being brought into the square.&nbsp; There was
considerable delay.&nbsp; The Inquisitor did not make his
appearance till noon, and then informed us that it was time to
go.&nbsp; The physician, also, presented himself, and advised us
to take a small glass of mint-water, which we accepted on account
of the extreme compassion which the good old man expressed for
us.&nbsp; It was Dr. Dosmo.&nbsp; The head bailiff then advanced
and fixed the hand-cuffs upon us.&nbsp; We followed him,
accompanied by the other bailiffs.</p>
<p>We next descended the magnificent staircase of the Giganti,
and we called to mind the old Doge Faliero, who was beheaded
there.&nbsp; We entered through the great gate which opens upon
the small square from the court-yard of the palace, and we then
turned to the left, in the direction of the lake.&nbsp; In the
centre of the small square was raised the scaffold which we were
to ascend.&nbsp; From the staircase of the Giganti, extending to
the scaffold, were two lines of Austrian soldiers, through which
we passed.</p>
<p>After ascending the platform, we looked around us, and saw an
immense assembly of people, apparently struck with terror.&nbsp;
In other directions were seen bands of armed men, to awe the
multitude; and we were told that cannon were loaded in readiness
to be discharged at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; I was now
exactly in the spot where, in September, 1820, just a month
previous to my arrest, a mendicant had observed to me,
&ldquo;This is a place of misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I called to mind the circumstance, and reflected that very
possibly in that immense throng of spectators the same person
might be present, and perhaps even recognise me.</p>
<p>The German Captain now called out to us to turn towards the
palace, and look up; we did so, and beheld, upon the lodge, a
messenger of the Council, with a letter in his hand; it was the
sentence; he began to read it in a loud voice.</p>
<p>It was ushered in by solemn silence, which was continued until
he came to the words, <i>Condemned to death</i>.&nbsp; There was
then heard one general murmur of compassion.&nbsp; This was
followed by a similar silence, in order to hear the rest of the
document.&nbsp; A fresh murmur arose on the announcement of the
following:&mdash;condemned to hard imprisonment, Maroncelli for
<i>twenty years</i>, and Pellico for <i>fifteen</i>.</p>
<p>The Captain made a sign for us to descend.&nbsp; We cast one
glance around us, and came down.&nbsp; We re-entered the
court-yard, mounted the great staircase, and were conducted into
the room from which we had been dragged.&nbsp; The manacles were
removed, and we were soon reconducted to San Michele.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prisoners who had been
condemned before us had already set out for Lubiana and
Spielberg, accompanied by a commissary of police.&nbsp; He was
now expected back, in order to conduct us to our destination; but
the interval of a month elapsed.</p>
<p>My time was chiefly spent in talking, and listening to the
conversation of others, in order to distract my attention.&nbsp;
Maroncelli read me some of his literary productions, and in turn,
I read him mine.&nbsp; One evening I read from the window my play
of <i>Ester d&rsquo;Engaddi</i>, to Canova, Rezia, and Armari;
and the following evening, the <i>Iginia d&rsquo;Asti</i>.&nbsp;
During the night, however, I grew irritable and wretched, and was
unable to sleep.&nbsp; I both desired and feared to learn in what
manner the tidings of my calamity had been received by my
family.</p>
<p>At length I got a letter from my father, and was grieved to
find, from the date, that my last to him had not been sent, as I
had requested of the Inquisitor, immediately!&nbsp; Thus my
unhappy father, while flattering himself that I should be set at
liberty, happening to take up the Milan Gazette, read the horrid
sentence which I had just received upon the scaffold.&nbsp; He
himself acquainted me with this fact, and left me to infer what
his feelings must have been on meeting thus suddenly with the sad
news.&nbsp; I cannot express the contempt and anger I felt on
learning that my letter had been kept back; and how deeply I felt
for all my poor unhappy family.&nbsp; There was doubtless no
malice in this delay, but I looked upon it as a refinement of the
most atrocious barbarity; an eager, infernal desire to see the
iron enter, as it were, the very soul of my beloved and innocent
relatives.&nbsp; I felt, indeed, as if I could have delighted to
shed a sea of blood, could I only punish this flagrant and
premeditated inhumanity.</p>
<p>Now that I judge calmly, I find it very improbable.&nbsp; The
delay, doubtless, was simply owing to inadvertency on the part of
subordinate agents.&nbsp; Enraged as I was, I heard with still
more excited feelings that my companions were about to celebrate
Easter week ere their departure.&nbsp; As for me, I considered it
wholly impossible, inasmuch as I felt not the least disposition
towards forgiveness.&nbsp; Should I be guilty of such a
scandal!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> length the German commissioner
arrived, and came to acquaint us that within two days we were to
set out.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have the pleasure,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;to give you some consoling tidings.&nbsp; On my return
from Spielberg, I saw his majesty the Emperor at Vienna, who
acquainted me that the penal days appointed you will not extend
to twenty-four hours, but only to twelve.&nbsp; By this
expression it is intended to signify that the pain will be
divided, or half the punishment remitted.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
division was never notified to us in an official form, but there
is no reason to suppose that the commissioner would state an
untruth; the less so as he made no secret of the information,
which was known to the whole commission.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I
could not congratulate myself upon it.&nbsp; To my feelings,
seven years and a half had little more horrible in them (to be
spent in chains and solitude) than fifteen; for I conceived it to
be impossible to survive so long a period.&nbsp; My health had
recently again become wretched!&nbsp; I suffered from severe
pains of the chest, attended with cough, and thought my lungs
were affected.&nbsp; I ate little, and that little I could not
digest.&nbsp; Our departure took place on the night of the 25th
of March.&nbsp; We were permitted to take leave of our friend,
Cesare Armari.&nbsp; A sbirro chained us in a transverse manner,
namely, the right hand and the left foot, so as to render it
impossible for us to escape.</p>
<p>We went into a gondola, and the guards rowed us towards
Fusina.&nbsp; On our arrival we found two boats in readiness for
us.&nbsp; Rezia and Canova were placed in one, and Maroncelli and
myself in the other.&nbsp; The commissary was also with two of
the prisoners, and an under-commissary with the others.&nbsp; Six
or seven guards of police completed our convoy; they were armed
with swords and muskets; some of them at hand in the boats,
others in the box of the Vetturino.</p>
<p>To be compelled by misfortune to leave one&rsquo;s country is
always sufficiently painful; but to be torn from it in chains,
doomed to exile in a horrible climate, to linger days, and hours,
and years, in solitary dungeons, is a fate so appalling as to
defy language to convey the remotest idea of it.</p>
<p>Ere we had traversed the Alps, I felt that my country was
becoming doubly dear to me; the sympathy we awakened on every
side, from all ranks, formed an irresistible appeal to my
affection and gratitude.&nbsp; In every city, in every village,
in every group of meanest houses, the news of our condemnation
had been known for some weeks, and we were expected.&nbsp; In
several places the commissioners and the guards had difficulty in
dispersing the crowd which surrounded us.&nbsp; It was
astonishing to witness the benevolent and humane feeling
generally manifested in our behalf.</p>
<p>In Udine we met with a singular and touching incident.&nbsp;
On arriving at the inn, the commissary caused the door of the
court-yard to be closed, in order to keep back the people.&nbsp;
A room was assigned us, and he ordered the waiters to bring
supper, and make such accommodation as we required for
repose.&nbsp; In a few moments three men entered with mattresses
upon their shoulders.&nbsp; What was our surprise to see that
only one of them was a servant of the inn; the other two were our
acquaintance.&nbsp; We pretended to assist them in placing the
beds, and had time to recognise and give each other the hand of
fellowship and sympathy.&nbsp; It was too much; the tears started
to our eyes.&nbsp; Ah! how trying was it to us all, not to be
allowed the sad satisfaction even of shedding them in a last
embrace.</p>
<p>The commissaries were not aware of the circumstance; but I had
reason to think that one of the guards saw into the affair, just
as the good Dario grasped me by the hand.&nbsp; He was a
Venetian; he fixed his eyes upon us both; he turned pale;
appeared in the act of making an alarm, then turned away his
eyes, as if pretending not to see us.&nbsp; If he felt not
assured that they were indeed our friends, he must have believed
them to be some waiters with whom we were acquainted.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning we left Udine by
dawn of day.&nbsp; The affectionate Dario was already in the
street, wrapped in his mantle; he beckoned to us and followed us
a long way.&nbsp; A coach also continued at some little distance
from us for several miles.&nbsp; Some one waved a handkerchief
from it, till it turned back; who could it have been?&nbsp; We
had our own conjectures on the subject.&nbsp; May Heaven protect
those generous spirits that thus cease not to love, and express
their love for the unfortunate.&nbsp; I had the more reason to
prize them from the fact of having met with cowards, who, not
content with denying me, thought to benefit themselves by
calumniating their once fortunate <i>friend</i>.&nbsp; These
cases, however, were rare, while those of the former, to the
honour of the human character, were numerous.</p>
<p>I had supposed that the warm sympathy expressed for us in
Italy would cease when we entered on a foreign soil.&nbsp; But I
was deceived; the good man is ever the fellow-countryman of the
unhappy!&nbsp; When traversing Illyrian and German ground, it was
the same as in our own country.&nbsp; There was the same general
lamentation at our fate; &ldquo;Arme herren!&rdquo; poor
gentlemen, was on the lips of all.</p>
<p>Sometimes, on entering another district, our escort was
compelled to stop in order to decide in what part to take up our
quarters.&nbsp; The people would then gather round us, and we
heard exclamations, and other expressions of commiseration, which
evidently came from the heart.&nbsp; These proofs of popular
feeling were still more gratifying to me, than such as I had met
with from my own countrymen.&nbsp; The consolation which was thus
afforded me, helped to soothe the bitter indignation I then felt
against those whom I esteemed my enemies.&nbsp; Yet, possibly, I
reflected, if we were brought more nearly acquainted, if I could
see into their real motives, and I could explain my own feelings,
I might be constrained to admit that they are not impelled by the
malignant spirit I suppose, while they would find there was as
little of bad in me.&nbsp; Nay, they might perhaps be induced not
only to pity, but to admire and love us!</p>
<p>It is true, indeed, that men too often hate each other, merely
because they are strangers to each other&rsquo;s real views and
feelings; and the simple interchange of a few words would make
them acknowledge their error, and give the hand of brotherhood to
each other.</p>
<p>We remained a day at Lubiana; and there Canova and Rezia were
separated from us, being forthwith conducted into the
castle.&nbsp; It is easy to guess our feelings upon this painful
occasion.</p>
<p>On the evening of our arrival at Lubiana and the day
following, a gentleman came and joined us, who, if I remember
rightly, announced himself as the municipal secretary.&nbsp; His
manners were gentle and humane, and he spoke of religion in a
tone at once elevated and impressive.&nbsp; I conjectured he must
be a priest, the priests in Germany being accustomed to dress
exactly in the same style as laymen.&nbsp; His countenance was
calculated to excite esteem.&nbsp; I regretted that I was not
enabled further to cultivate his acquaintance, and I blame myself
for my inadvertency in not having taken down his name.</p>
<p>It irks me, too, that I cannot at this time recall the name of
another gentle being, a young girl of Styria, who followed us
through the crowd, and when our coach stopped for a few minutes,
moved towards us with both hands, and afterwards, turned weeping
away, supported by a young man, whose light hair proclaimed him
of German extraction.&nbsp; But most probably he had been in
Italy, where he had fallen in love with our fair countrywoman,
and felt touched for our country.&nbsp; Yes! what pleasure it
would have given me to record the names of those venerable
fathers and mothers of families, who, in different districts,
accosted us on our road, inquiring if we had parents and friends;
and on hearing that we had, would grow pale, and exclaim,
&ldquo;Alas! may it please God to restore you soon to those
wretched, bereaved ones whom you have left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 10th of April we arrived at
our place of destination.&nbsp; The city of Br&uuml;nn is the
capital of Moravia, where the governor of the two provinces of
Moravia and Silesia is accustomed to reside.&nbsp; Situated in a
pleasant valley, it presents a rich and noble aspect.&nbsp; At
one time it was a great manufactory of cloth, but its prosperous
days were now passed, and its population did not exceed thirty
thousand.</p>
<p>Contiguous to the walls on the western side rises a mount, and
on this is placed the dreaded fortress of Spielberg, once the
royal seat of the lords of Moravia, and now the most terrific
prison under the Austrian monarchy.&nbsp; It was a well-guarded
citadel, but was bombarded and taken by the French after the
celebrated battle of Austerlitz, a village at a little distance
from it.&nbsp; It was not generally repaired, with the exception
of a portion of the outworks, which had been wholly
demolished.&nbsp; Within it are imprisoned some three hundred
wretches, for the most part robbers and assassins, some condemned
to the <i>carcere dare</i>, others to that called
<i>durissimo</i>, the severest of all.&nbsp; This <span
class="GutSmall">HARD IMPRISONMENT</span> comprehends compulsory,
daily labour, to wear chains on the legs, to sleep upon bare
boards, and to eat the worst imaginable food.&nbsp; The
<i>durissimo</i>, or hardest, signifies being chained in a more
horrible manner, one part of the iron being fixed in the wall,
united to a hoop round the body of the prisoner, so as to prevent
his moving further than the board which serves for his
couch.&nbsp; We, as state prisoners, were condemned to the
<i>carcere duro</i>.&nbsp; The food, however, is the same, though
in the words of the law it is prescribed to be bread and
water.</p>
<p>While mounting the acclivity we turned our eyes as if to take
a last look of the world we were leaving, doubting if ever the
portals of that living grave would be again unclosed to us.&nbsp;
I was calm, but rage and indignation consumed my heart.&nbsp; It
was in vain I had recourse to philosophy; it had no arguments to
quiet or to support me.</p>
<p>I was in poor health on leaving Venice, and the journey had
fatigued me exceedingly.&nbsp; I had a fever, and felt severe
pains, both in my head and my limbs.&nbsp; Illness increased my
irritation, and very probably the last had an equally ill effect
upon my frame.</p>
<p>We were consigned over to the superintendent of Spielberg, and
our names were registered in the same list as that of the
robbers.&nbsp; The imperial commissary shook our hands upon
taking leave, and was evidently affected.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and let me recommend to
you calmness and submission: for I assure you the least
infraction of discipline will be punished by the governor in the
severest manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The consignment being made out, my friend and myself were
conducted into a subterranean gallery, where two dismal-looking
dungeons were unlocked, at a distance from each other.&nbsp; In
one of these I was entombed alive, and poor Maroncelli in the
other.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">How</span> bitter is it, after having bid
adieu to so many beloved objects, and there remains only a single
one between yourself and utter solitude, the solitude of chains
and a living death, to be separated even from that one!&nbsp;
Maroncelli, on leaving me, ill and dejected, shed tears over me
as one whom, it was most probable, he would never more
behold.&nbsp; In him, too, I lamented a noble-minded man, cut off
in the splendour of his intellect, and the vigour of his days,
snatched from society, all its duties and its pleasures, and even
from &ldquo;the common air, the earth, the sky.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet
he survived the unheard of afflictions heaped upon him, but in
what a state did he leave his living tomb!</p>
<p>When I found myself alone in that horrid cavern, heard the
closing of the iron doors, the rattling of chains, and by the
gloomy light of a high window, saw the wooden bench destined for
my couch, with an enormous chain fixed in the wall, I sat down,
in sullen rage, on my hard resting-place, and taking up the
chain, measured its length, in the belief that it was destined
for me.</p>
<p>In half an hour I caught the sound of locks and keys; the door
opened, and the head-jailer handed me a jug of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is something to drink,&rdquo; he said in a rough
tone, &ldquo;and you will have your loaf to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, my good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not good,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worse for you,&rdquo; I answered, rather
sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;And this great chain,&rdquo; I added,
&ldquo;is it for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Sir; if you don&rsquo;t happen to be quiet; if
you get into a rage, or say impertinent things.&nbsp; But if you
are reasonable, we shall only chain you by the feet.&nbsp; The
blacksmith is getting all ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then walked sullenly up and down, shaking that horrid ring
of enormous keys, while with angry eye I measured his gigantic,
lean, and aged figure.&nbsp; His features, though not decidedly
vulgar, bore the most repulsive expression of brutal severity
which I ever beheld!</p>
<p>How unjust are mankind when they presume to judge by
appearances, and in deference to their vain, arrogant
prejudices.&nbsp; The man whom I upbraided in my heart for
shaking as it were in triumph those horrible keys, to make me
more keenly sensible of his power, whom I set down as an
insignificant tyrant, inured to practices of cruelty, was then
revolving thoughts of compassion, and assuredly had spoken in
that harsh tone only to conceal his real feelings.&nbsp; Perhaps
he was afraid to trust himself, or that I should prove unworthy
gentler treatment; doubtful whether I might not be yet more
criminal than unhappy, though willing to afford me relief.</p>
<p>Annoyed by his presence, and the sort of lordly air he
assumed, I determined to try to humble him, and called out as if
speaking to a servant, &ldquo;Give me something to
drink!&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked at me, as much as to say,
&ldquo;Arrogant man! this is no place for you to show the airs of
a master.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still he was silent, bent his long back,
took up the jug, and gave it to me.&nbsp; I perceived, as I took
it from him, that he trembled, and believing it to proceed from
age, I felt a mingled emotion of reverence and compassion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; I inquired in a kinder tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-four, Sir; I have lived to see great
calamities, both as regards others and myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tremulous emotion I had observed increased as he said
this, and again took the jug from my hand.&nbsp; I now thought it
might be owing to some nobler feeling than the effect of age, and
the aversion I had conceived instantaneously left me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is your name?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It pleased fortune, Sir, to make a fool of me, by
giving me the name of a great man.&nbsp; My name is
Schiller.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then told me in a few words, some
particulars as to his native place, his family, the campaigns in
which he had served, and the wounds he had received.</p>
<p>He was a Switzer, the son of peasants, had been in the wars
against the Turks, under Marshal Laudon, in the reign of Maria
Theresa and Joseph II.&nbsp; He had subsequently served in the
Austrian campaigns against France, up to the period of
Napoleon&rsquo;s exile.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we begin to form a better
opinion of one against whom we had conceived a strong prejudice,
we seem to discover in every feature, in his voice, and manner,
fresh marks of a good disposition, to which we were before
strangers.&nbsp; Is this real, or is it not rather founded upon
illusion?&nbsp; Shortly before, we interpreted the very same
expressions in another way.&nbsp; Our judgment of moral qualities
has undergone a change, and soon, the conclusions drawn from our
knowledge of physiognomy are equally different.&nbsp; How many
portraits of celebrated men inspire us only with respect or
admiration because we know their characters; portraits which we
should have pronounced worthless and unattractive had they
represented the ordinary race of mortals.&nbsp; And thus it is,
if we reason <i>vice versa</i>.&nbsp; I once laughed, I remember,
at a lady, who on beholding a likeness of Catiline mistook it for
that of Collatinus, and remarked upon the sublime expression of
grief in the features of Collatinus for the loss of his
Lucretia.&nbsp; These sort of illusions are not uncommon.&nbsp; I
would not maintain that the features of good men do not bear the
impression of their character, like irreclaimable villains that
of their depravity; but that there are many which have at least a
doubtful cast.&nbsp; In short, I won a little upon old Schiller;
I looked at him more attentively, and he no longer appeared
forbidding.&nbsp; To say the truth, there was something in his
language which, spite of its rough tone, showed the genuine
traits of a noble mind.&nbsp; And spite of our first looks of
mutual distrust and defiance, we seemed to feel a certain respect
for each other; he spoke boldly what he thought, and so did
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain as I am,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;I have
fallen,&mdash;to take my rest, into this wretched post of jailer;
and God knows it is far more disagreeable for me to maintain it,
than it was to risk my life in battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was now sorry I had asked him so haughtily to give me
drink.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear Schiller,&rdquo; I said, grasping his
hand, &ldquo;it is in vain you deny it, I know you are a good
fellow; and as I have fallen into this calamity, I thank heaven
which has given me you for a guardian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened to me, shook his head, and then rubbing his
forehead, like a man in some perplexity or trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sir, I am bad&mdash;rank bad.&nbsp; They made me
take an oath, which I must, and will keep.&nbsp; I am bound to
treat all the prisoners, without distinction, with equal
severity; no indulgence, no permission to relent, to soften the
sternest orders, in particular as regards prisoners of
state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a noble fellow; I respect you for making your
duty a point of conscience.&nbsp; You may err, humanly speaking,
but your motives are pure in the eyes of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor gentleman, have patience, and pity me.&nbsp; I
shall be hard as steel in my duty, but my heart bleeds to be
unable to relieve the unfortunate.&nbsp; This is all I really
wished to say.&rdquo;&nbsp; We were both affected.</p>
<p>He then entreated that I would preserve my calmness, and not
give way to passion, as is too frequent with solitary prisoners,
and calls for restraint, and even for severer punishment.</p>
<p>He afterwards resumed his gruff, affected tone as if to
conceal the compassion he felt for me, observing that it was high
time for him to go.</p>
<p>He came back, however, and inquired how long a time I had been
afflicted with that horrible cough, reflecting sharply upon the
physician for not coming to see me that very evening.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are ill of a horse fever,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I
know it well; you will stand in need of a straw bed, but we
cannot give you one till the doctor has ordered it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He retired, locked the door, and I threw myself upon the hard
boards, with considerable fever and pain in my chest, but less
irritable, less at enmity with mankind, and less alienated from
God.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the evening came the
superintendent, attended by Schiller, another captain, and two
soldiers, to make the usual search.&nbsp; Three of these
inquisitions were ordered each day, at morning, noon, and
midnight.&nbsp; Every corner of the prison was examined, and each
article of the most trivial kind.&nbsp; The inferior officers
then left, and the superintendent remained a little time to
converse with me.</p>
<p>The first time I saw this troop of jailers approach, a strange
thought came into my head.&nbsp; Being unacquainted with their
habits of search, and half delirious with fever, it struck me
that they were come to take my life, and seizing my great chain I
resolved to sell it dearly by knocking the first upon the head
that offered to molest me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mean you?&rdquo; exclaimed the superintendent;
&ldquo;we are not going to hurt you.&nbsp; It is merely a formal
visit to ascertain that all is in proper order in the
prisons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated, but when I saw Schiller advance and stretch forth
his hand with a kind, paternal look, I dropped the chain and took
his proffered hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord! how it burns,&rdquo; he
said, turning towards the superintendent; &ldquo;he ought at
least to have a straw bed;&rdquo; and he said this in so truly
compassionate a tone as quite to win my heart.&nbsp; The
superintendent then felt my pulse, and spoke some consolatory
words: he was a man of gentlemanly manners, but dared not for his
life express any opinion upon the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all a reign of terror here,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;even as regards myself.&nbsp; Should I not execute my
orders to the rigour of the letter, you would no longer see me
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Schiller made a long face, and I could have
wagered he said within himself, &ldquo;But if I were at the head,
like you, I would not carry my apprehensions so very far; for to
give an opinion on a matter of such evident necessity, and so
innocuous to government, would never be esteemed a mighty
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When left alone, I felt my heart, so long incapable of any
deep sense of religion, stirred within me, and knelt down to
pray.&nbsp; I besought a blessing upon the head of old Schiller,
and appealing to God, asked that he would so move the hearts of
those around me, as to permit me to become attached to them, and
no longer suffer me to hate my fellow-beings, humbly accepting
all that was to be inflicted upon me from His hand.</p>
<p>About midnight I heard people passing along the gallery.&nbsp;
Keys were sounding, and soon the door opened; it was the captain
and his guards on search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is my old Schiller?&rdquo; inquired I.&nbsp; He
had stopped outside in the gallery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here&mdash;I am here!&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp;
He came towards the table, and, feeling my pulse, hung over me as
a father would over his child with anxious and inquiring
look.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I remember,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to-morrow is Thursday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of that?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! it is just one of the days when the doctor does
not attend, he comes only on a Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday.&nbsp; Plague on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give yourself no uneasiness about that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No uneasiness, no uneasiness!&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;but I do; you are ill, I see; nothing is talked of in the
whole town but the arrival of yourself and friends; the doctor
must have heard of it; and why the devil could he not make the
extraordinary exertion of coming once out of his time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he may perhaps be here
to-morrow,&mdash;Thursday though it will be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man said no more, he gave me a squeeze of the hand,
enough to break every bone in my fingers, as a mark of his
approbation of my courage and resignation.&nbsp; I was a little
angry with him, however, much as a young lover, if the girl of
his heart happen in dancing to press her foot upon his; he laughs
and esteems himself highly favoured, instead of crying out with
the pain.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXI.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">awoke</span> on Thursday morning, after
a horrible night, weak, aching in all my bones, from the hard
boards, and in a profuse perspiration.&nbsp; The visit hour came,
but the superintendent was absent; and he only followed at a more
convenient time.&nbsp; I said to Schiller, &ldquo;Just see how
terribly I perspire; but it is now growing cold upon me; what a
treat it would be to change my shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot do it,&rdquo; he said, in a brutal
tone.&nbsp; At the same time he winked, and moved his hand.&nbsp;
The captain and guards withdrew, and Schiller made me another
sign as he closed the door.&nbsp; He soon opened it again, and
brought one of his own shirts, long enough to cover me from head
to feet, even if doubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is perhaps a little too long, but I have no others
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, friend, but as I brought with me a whole
trunk full of linen, I do hope I may be permitted the use of
it.&nbsp; Have the kindness to ask the superintendent to let me
have one of my shirts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not be permitted, Sir, to use any of your
linen here.&nbsp; Each week you will have a shirt given you from
the house like the other prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, good man, in what a condition I am.&nbsp; I
shall never go out of here alive.&nbsp; I shall never be able to
reward you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame, Sir! for shame!&rdquo; said the old
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Talk of reward to one who can do you no good!
to one who dare hardly give a dry shirt to a sick fellow creature
in a sweat!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then helped me on with his long
shirt, grumbling all the while, and slammed the door to with
violence on going out, as if he had been in a great rage.</p>
<p>About two hours after, he brought me a piece of black
bread.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is your two
days&rsquo; fare!&rdquo; he then began to walk about in a sulky
mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; I inquired; &ldquo;are you
vexed at me?&nbsp; You know I took the shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am enraged at that doctor; though it be Thursday he
might show his ugly face here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience!&rdquo; said I; but though I said it, I knew
not for the life of me how to get the least rest, without a
pillow, upon those hard boards.&nbsp; Every bone in my body
suffered.&nbsp; At eleven I was treated to the prison
dinner&mdash;two little iron pots, one of soup, the other of
herbs, mixed in such a way as to turn your stomach with the
smell.&nbsp; I tried to swallow a few spoonfuls, but did not
succeed.&nbsp; Schiller encouraged me: &ldquo;Never
despair,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;try again; you will get used to
it in time.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t, you will be like many
others before you, unable to eat anything but bread, and die of
mere inanition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friday morning came, and with it came Dr. Bayer at last.&nbsp;
He found me very feverish, ordered me a straw bed, and insisted I
should be removed from the caverns into one of the abodes
above.&nbsp; It could not be done; there was no room.&nbsp; An
appeal was made to the Governor of Moravia and Silesia, residing
at Br&uuml;nn, who commanded, on the urgency of the case, that
the medical advice should be followed.</p>
<p>There was a little light in the room to which I was
removed.&nbsp; I crawled towards the bars of the narrow window,
and had the delight of seeing the valley that lay
below,&mdash;part of the city of Br&uuml;nn,&mdash;a suburb with
gardens,&mdash;the churchyard,&mdash;the little lake of
Certosa,&mdash;and the woody hills which lay between us and the
famous plains of Austerlitz.&nbsp; I was enchanted, and oh, what
double pleasure, thought I, would be mine, were I enabled to
share it with my poor friend Maroncelli!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, our prison dresses were
making for us, and five days afterwards mine was brought to
me.&nbsp; It consisted of a pair of pantaloons made of rough
cloth, of which the right side was grey, the left of a dark
colour.&nbsp; The waistcoat was likewise of two colours equally
divided, as well as the jacket, but with the same colours placed
on the contrary sides.&nbsp; The stockings were of the coarsest
wool; the shirt of linen tow full of sharp points&mdash;a true
hair-cloth garment; and round the neck was a piece of the same
kind.&nbsp; Our legs were enveloped in leather buskins, untanned,
and we wore a coarse white hat.</p>
<p>This costume was not complete without the addition of chains
to the feet, that is, extending from one leg to the other, the
joints being fastened with nails, which were riveted upon an
anvil.&nbsp; The blacksmith employed upon my legs, in this
operation, observed to one of the guards, thinking I knew nothing
of German, &ldquo;So ill as he is, one would think they might
spare him this sort of fun; ere two months be over, the angel of
death will loosen these rivets of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>M&ouml;chte es seyn</i>! may it be so!&rdquo; was my
reply, as I touched him upon the shoulder.&nbsp; The poor fellow
started, and seemed quite confused; he then said; &ldquo;I hope I
may be a false prophet; and I wish you may be set free by another
kind of angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, rather than live thus, think you not, it would be
welcome even from the angel of death?&rdquo;&nbsp; He nodded his
head, and went away, with a look of deep compassion for me.</p>
<p>I would truly have been willing to die, but I felt no
disposition towards suicide.&nbsp; I felt confident that the
disease of my lungs would be enough, ere long, to give me
freedom.&nbsp; Such was not the will of God.&nbsp; The fatigue of
my journey had made me much worse, but rest seemed again to
restore my powers.</p>
<p>A few minutes after the blacksmith left me, I heard the hammer
sounding upon the anvil in one of the caverns below.&nbsp;
Schiller was then in my room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you hear those
blows?&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;they are certainly fixing the irons
on poor Maroncelli.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea for the moment was so
overwhelming, that if the old man had not caught me, I should
have fallen.&nbsp; For more than half an hour, I continued in a
kind of swoon, and yet I was sensible.&nbsp; I could not speak,
my pulse scarcely beat at all; a cold sweat bathed me from head
to foot.&nbsp; Still I could hear all that Schiller said, and had
a keen perception, both of what had passed and was passing.</p>
<p>By command of the superintendent and the activity of the
guards, the whole of the adjacent prisons had been kept in a
state of profound silence.&nbsp; Three or four times I had caught
snatches of some Italian song, but they were quickly stifled by
the calls of the sentinels on duty.&nbsp; Several of these were
stationed upon the ground-floor, under our windows, and one in
the gallery close by, who was continually engaged in listening at
the doors and looking through the bars to forbid every kind of
noise.</p>
<p>Once, towards evening (I feel the same sort of emotion
whenever I recur to it), it happened that the sentinels were less
on the alert; and I heard in a low but clear voice some one
singing in a prison adjoining my own.&nbsp; What joy, what
agitation I felt at the sound.&nbsp; I rose from my bed of straw,
I bent my ear; and when it ceased&mdash;I burst into tears.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who art thou, unhappy one?&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;who art
thou? tell me thy name!&nbsp; I am Silvio Pellico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Silvio!&rdquo; cried my neighbour, &ldquo;I know
you not by person, but I have long loved you.&nbsp; Get up to
your window, and let us speak to each other, in spite of the
jailers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I crawled up as well as I could; he told me his name, and we
exchanged few words of kindness.&nbsp; It was the Count Antonio
Oroboni, a native of Fratta, near Rovigo, and only twenty-nine
years of age.&nbsp; Alas! we were soon interrupted by the
ferocious cries of the sentinels.&nbsp; He in the gallery knocked
as loud as he could with the butt-end of his musket, both at the
Count&rsquo;s door and at mine.&nbsp; We would not, and we could
not obey; but the noise, the oaths, and threats of the guards
were such as to drown our voices, and after arranging that we
would resume our communications, upon a change of guards, we
ceased to converse.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were in hopes (and so in fact it
happened) that by speaking in a lower tone, and perhaps
occasionally having guards whose humanity might prompt them to
pay no attention to us, we might renew our conversation.&nbsp; By
dint of practice we learnt to hear each other in so low a key
that the sounds were almost sure to escape the notice of the
sentinels.&nbsp; If, as it rarely happened, we forgot ourselves,
and talked aloud, there came down upon us a torrent of cries, and
knocks at our doors, accompanied with threats and curses of every
kind, to say nothing of poor Schiller&rsquo;s vexation, and that
of the superintendent.</p>
<p>By degrees, however, we brought our system to perfection;
spoke only at the precise minutes, quarters, and half hours when
it was safe, or when such and such guards were upon duty.&nbsp;
At length, with moderate caution, we were enabled every day to
converse almost as much as we pleased, without drawing on us the
attention or anger of any of the superior officers.</p>
<p>It was thus we contracted an intimate friendship.&nbsp; The
Count told me his adventures, and in turn I related mine.&nbsp;
We sympathised in everything we heard, and in all each
other&rsquo;s joys or griefs.&nbsp; It was of infinite advantage
to us, as well as pleasure; for often, after passing a sleepless
night, one or the other would hasten to the window and salute his
friend.&nbsp; How these mutual welcomes and conversations helped
to encourage us, and to soothe the horrors of our continued
solitude!&nbsp; We felt that we were useful to each other; and
the sense of this roused a gentle emulation in all our thoughts,
and gave a satisfaction which man receives, even in misery, when
he knows he can serve a fellow-creature.&nbsp; Each conversation
gave rise to new ones; it was necessary to continue them, and to
explain as we went on.&nbsp; It was an unceasing stimulus to our
ideas to our reason, our memory, our imagination, and our
hearts.</p>
<p>At first, indeed, calling to mind Julian, I was doubtful as to
the fidelity of this new friend.&nbsp; I reflected that hitherto
we had not been at variance; but some day I feared something
unpleasant might occur, and that I should then be sent back to my
solitude.&nbsp; But this suspicion was soon removed.&nbsp; Our
opinions harmonised upon all essential points.&nbsp; To a noble
mind, full of ardour and generous sentiment, undaunted by
misfortune, he added the most clear and perfect faith in
Christianity, while in me this had become vacillating and at
times apparently extinct.</p>
<p>He met my doubts with most just and admirable reflections; and
with equal affection, I felt that he had reason on his side: I
admitted it, yet still my doubts returned.&nbsp; It is thus, I
believe, with all who have not the Gospel at heart, and who hate,
or indulge resentments of any kind.&nbsp; The mind catches
glimpses, as it were, of the truth, but as it is unpleasing, it
is disbelieved the moment after, and the attention directed
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Oroboni was indefatigable in turning <i>my</i> attention to
the motives which man has to show kindness to his enemies.&nbsp;
I never spoke of any one I abhorred but he began in a most
dexterous manner to defend him, and not less by his words than by
his example.&nbsp; Many men had injured him; it grieved him, yet
he forgave all, and had the magnanimity to relate some laudable
trait or other belonging to each, and seemed to do it with
pleasure.</p>
<p>The irritation which had obtained such a mastery over me, and
rendered me so irreligious after my condemnation, continued
several weeks, and then wholly ceased.&nbsp; The noble virtue of
Oroboni delighted me.&nbsp; Struggling as well as I could to
reach him, I at least trod in the same track, and I was then
enabled to pray with sincerity; to forgive, to hate no one, and
dissipate every remaining doubt and gloom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> say truth, if our punishment was
excessively severe, and calculated to irritate the mind, we had
still the rare fortune of meeting only with individuals of real
worth.&nbsp; They could not, indeed, alleviate our situation,
except by kindness and respect, but so much was freely
granted.&nbsp; If there were something rude and uncouth in old
Schiller, it was amply compensated by his noble spirit.&nbsp;
Even the wretched Kunda (the convict who brought us our dinner,
and water three times a day) was anxious to show his compassion
for us.&nbsp; He swept our rooms regularly twice in the
week.&nbsp; One morning, while thus engaged, as Schiller turned a
few steps from the door, poor Kunda offered me a piece of white
bread.&nbsp; I refused it, but squeezed him cordially by the
hand.&nbsp; He was moved, and told me, in bad German, that he was
a Pole.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good sir,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;they give
us so little to eat here, that I am sure you must be
hungry.&rdquo;&nbsp; I assured him I was not, but he was very
hard of belief.</p>
<p>The physician, perceiving that we were none of us enabled to
swallow the kind of food prepared for us on our first arrival,
put us all upon what is considered the hospital diet.&nbsp; This
consisted of three very small plates of soup in the day, the
least slice of roast lamb, hardly a mouthful, and about three
ounces of white bread.</p>
<p>As my health continued to improve, my appetite grew better,
and that &ldquo;fourth portion,&rdquo; as they termed it, was
really too little, and I began to feel the justice of poor
Kunda&rsquo;s remarks.&nbsp; I tried a return to the sound diet,
but do what I would to conquer my aversion, it was all labour
lost.&nbsp; I was compelled to live upon the fourth part of
ordinary meals: and for a whole year I knew by experience the
tortures of hunger.&nbsp; It was still more severely felt by many
of my fellow-prisoners, who, being far stouter, had been
accustomed to a full and generous diet.&nbsp; I learnt that many
of them were glad to accept pieces of bread from Schiller and
some of the guards, and even from the poor hungry Kunda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is reported in the city,&rdquo; said the barber, a
young practitioner of our surgery, one day to me, &ldquo;it is
reported that they do not give you gentlemen here enough to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is very true,&rdquo; replied I, with perfect
sincerity.</p>
<p>The next Sunday (he came always on that day) he brought me an
immense white loaf, and Schiller pretended not to see him give it
me.&nbsp; Had I listened to my stomach I should have accepted it,
but I would not, lest he should repeat the gift and bring himself
into some trouble.&nbsp; For the same reason I refused
Schiller&rsquo;s offers.&nbsp; He would often bring me boiled
meat, entreating me to partake of it, and protesting it cost him
nothing; besides, he knew not what to do with it, and must give
it away to somebody.&nbsp; I could have devoured it, but would he
not then be tempted to offer me something or other every day, and
what would it end in?&nbsp; Twice only I partook of some cherries
and some pears; they were quite irresistible.&nbsp; I was
punished as I expected, for from that time forth the old man
never ceased bringing me fruit of some kind or other.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was arranged, on our arrival,
that each of us should be permitted to walk an hour twice in the
week.&nbsp; In the sequel, this relief was one day granted us and
another refused; and the hour was always later during
festivals.</p>
<p>We went, each separately, between two guards, with loaded
muskets on their shoulders.&nbsp; In passing from my prison, at
the head of the gallery, I went by the whole of the Italian
prisoners, with the exception of Maroncelli&mdash;the only one
condemned to linger in the caverns below.&nbsp; &ldquo;A pleasant
walk!&rdquo; whispered they all, as they saw me pass; but I was
not allowed to exchange a single word.</p>
<p>I was led down a staircase which opened into a spacious court,
where we walked upon a terrace, with a south aspect, and a view
of the city of Br&uuml;nn and the surrounding country.&nbsp; In
this courtyard we saw numbers of the common criminals, coming
from, or going to, their labour, or passing along conversing in
groups.&nbsp; Among them were several Italian robbers, who
saluted me with great respect.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is no rogue, like
us; yet you see his punishment is more severe&rdquo;; and it was
true, they had a larger share of freedom than I.</p>
<p>Upon hearing expressions like these, I turned and saluted them
with a good-natured look.&nbsp; One of them observed, &ldquo;It
does me good to see you, sir, when you notice me.&nbsp; Possibly
you may see something in my look not so very wicked.&nbsp; An
unhappy passion instigated me to commit a crime, but believe me,
sir, I am no villain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this he burst into tears.&nbsp; I gave him my hand, but
he was unable to return the pressure.&nbsp; At that moment, my
guard, according to their instructions, drove him away, declaring
that they must permit no one to approach me.&nbsp; The
observations subsequently addressed to me were pretended to be
spoken among each other; and if my two attendants became aware of
it, they quickly interposed silence.</p>
<p>Prisoners of various ranks, and visitors of the
superintendent, the chaplain, the sergeant, or some of the
captains, were likewise to be seen there.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is an
Italian, that is an Italian!&rdquo; they often whispered each
other.&nbsp; They stopped to look at me, and they would say in
German, supposing I should not understand them, &ldquo;That poor
gentleman will not live to be old; he has death in his
countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, after recovering some degree of strength, I again
fell ill for want of nourishment, and fever again attacked
me.&nbsp; I attempted to drag myself, as far as my chain would
permit, along the walk, and throwing myself upon the turf, I
rested there until the expiration of my hour.&nbsp; The guards
would then sit down near me, and begin to converse with each
other.&nbsp; One of them, a Bohemian, named Kral, had, though
very poor, received some sort of an education, which he had
himself improved by reflection.&nbsp; He was fond of reading, had
studied Klopstock, Wieland, Goethe, Schiller, and many other
distinguished German writers.&nbsp; He knew a good deal by
memory, and repeated many passages with feeling and
correctness.&nbsp; The other guard was a Pole, by name Kubitzky,
wholly untaught, but kind and respectful.&nbsp; Their society was
a great relief to me.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> one end of the terrace was
situated the apartments of the superintendent, at the other was
the residence of a captain, with his wife and son.&nbsp; When I
saw any one appear from these buildings, I was in the habit of
approaching near, and was invariably received with marks of
courtesy and compassion.</p>
<p>The wife of the captain had been long ill, and appeared to be
in a decline.&nbsp; She was sometimes carried into the open air,
and it was astonishing to see the sympathy she expressed for our
sufferings.&nbsp; She had the sweetest look I ever saw; and
though evidently timid, would at times fix her eye upon me with
an inquiring, confiding glance, when appealed to by name.&nbsp;
One day I observed to her with a smile, &ldquo;Do you know,
signora, I find a resemblance between you and one who was very
dear to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She blushed, and replied with charming
simplicity, &ldquo;Do not then forget me when I shall be no more;
pray for my unhappy soul, and for the little ones I leave behind
me!&rdquo;&nbsp; I never saw her after that day; she was unable
to rise from her bed, and in a few months I heard of her
death.</p>
<p>She left three sons, all beautiful as cherubs, and one still
an infant at the breast.&nbsp; I had often seen the poor mother
embrace them when I was by, and say, with tears in her eyes,
&ldquo;Who will be their mother when I am gone?&nbsp; Ah, whoever
she may be, may it please the Father of all to inspire her with
love, even for children not her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Often, when she was no more, did I embrace those fair
children, shed a tear over them, and invoke their mother&rsquo;s
blessing on them, in the same words.&nbsp; Thoughts of my own
mother, and of the prayers she so often offered up for <i>her</i>
lost son, would then come over me, and I added, with broken words
and sighs, &ldquo;Oh, happier mother than mine, you left, indeed,
these innocent ones, so young and fair, but my dear mother
devoted long years of care and tenderness to me, and saw them
all, with the object of them, snatched from her at a
blow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These children were intrusted to the care of two elderly and
excellent women; one of them the mother, the other the aunt of
the superintendent.&nbsp; They wished to hear the whole of my
history, and I gave it them as briefly as I could.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How greatly we regret,&rdquo; they observed, with warm
sympathy, &ldquo;to be unable to help you in any way.&nbsp; Be
assured, however, we offer up constant prayers for you, and if
ever the day come that brings you liberty, it will be celebrated
by all our family, like one of the happiest festivals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first-mentioned of these ladies had a remarkably sweet and
soothing voice, united to an eloquence rarely to be heard from
the lips of woman.&nbsp; I listened to her religious exhortations
with a feeling of filial gratitude, and they sunk deep into my
heart.&nbsp; Though her observations were not new to me, they
were always applicable, and most valuable to me, as will appear
from what follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Misfortune cannot degrade a man, unless he be
intrinsically mean; it rather elevates
him.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;If we could penetrate the judgments of
God, we should find that frequently the objects most to be pitied
were the conquerors, not the conquered; the joyous rather than
the sorrowful; the wealthy rather than those who are despoiled of
all.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The particular kindness shown by the
Saviour of mankind to the unfortunate is a striking
fact.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That man ought to feel honoured in
bearing the cross, when he considers that it was borne up the
mount of our redemption by the Divinity himself in human
form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were among the excellent sentiments she inculcated; but
it was my lot, as usual, to lose these delightful friends when I
had become most attached to them.&nbsp; They removed from the
castle, and the sweet children no longer made their appearance
upon the terrace.&nbsp; I felt this double deprivation more than
I can express.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> inconvenience I experienced
from the chain upon my legs, which prevented me from sleeping,
destroyed my health.&nbsp; Schiller wished me to petition,
declaring that it was the duty of the physician to order it to be
taken off.&nbsp; For some time I refused to listen to him, I then
yielded, and informed the doctor that, in order to obtain a
little sleep, I should be thankful to have the chain removed, if
only for a few days.&nbsp; He answered that my fever was not yet
so bad as to require it; and that it was necessary I should
become accustomed to the chain.&nbsp; I felt indignant at this
reply, and more so at myself for having asked the favour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See what I have got by following your advice,&rdquo; said
I to Schiller; and I said it in a very sharp tone, not a little
offensive to the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are vexed,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;because you
met with a denial; and I am as much so with your arrogance!&nbsp;
Could I help it?&rdquo;&nbsp; He then began a long sermon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The proud value themselves mightily in never exposing
themselves to a refusal, in never accepting an offer, in being
ashamed at a thousand little matters.&nbsp; <i>Alle eselen</i>,
asses as they all are.&nbsp; Vain grandeur, want of true dignity,
which consists in being ashamed only of bad actions!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He went off, and made the door ring with a tremendous noise.</p>
<p>I was dismayed; yet his rough sincerity scarcely displeased
me.&nbsp; Had he not spoken the truth? to how many weaknesses had
I not given the name of dignity! the result of nothing but
pride.</p>
<p>At the dinner hour Schiller left my fare to the convict Kunda,
who brought me some water, while Schiller stood outside.&nbsp; I
called him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no time,&rdquo; he replied, very
drily.</p>
<p>I rose, and going to him, said, &ldquo;If you wish my dinner
to agree with me, pray don&rsquo;t look so horribly sour; it is
worse than vinegar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how ought I to look?&rdquo; he asked, rather more
appeased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheerful, and like a friend,&rdquo; was my reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be merry, then!&nbsp; <i>Viva
l&rsquo;allegria</i>!&rdquo; cried the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
if it will make your dinner agree with you, I will dance you a
hornpipe into the bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, assuming a broad
grin, he set to work with his long, lean, spindle shanks, which
he worked about like two huge stilts, till I thought I should
have died with laughing.&nbsp; I laughed and almost cried at the
same time.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening Count Oroboni and I
were standing at our windows complaining of the low diet to which
we were subjected.&nbsp; Animated by the subject, we talked a
little too loud, and the sentinels began to upbraid us.&nbsp; The
superintendent, indeed, called in a loud voice to Schiller, as he
happened to be passing, inquiring in a threatening voice why he
did not keep a better watch, and teach us to be silent?&nbsp;
Schiller came in a great rage to complain of me, and ordered me
never more to think of speaking from the window.&nbsp; He wished
me to promise that I would not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;I shall do no such
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>der Teufel</i>; <i>der Teufel</i>!&rdquo; <a
name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a> exclaimed the old man; &ldquo;do you
say that to me?&nbsp; Have I not had a horrible strapping on your
account?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, dear Schiller, if you have suffered on my
account.&nbsp; But I cannot promise what I do not mean to
perform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not perform it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I cannot; because this continual solitude is
such a torment to me.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I will speak as long as I
have breath, and invite my neighbour to talk to me.&nbsp; If he
refuse I will talk to my window-bars, I will talk to the hills
before me, I will talk to the birds as they fly about.&nbsp; I
will talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Der Teufel</i>! you will!&nbsp; You had better
promise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no! never!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>He threw down his huge bunch of keys, and ran about, crying,
&ldquo;<i>Der Teufel</i>! <i>der Teufel</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then,
all at once, he threw his long bony arms about my neck: &ldquo;By
&mdash;, and you shall talk!&nbsp; Am I to cease to be a man
because of this vile mob of keys?&nbsp; You are a gentleman, and
I like your spirit!&nbsp; I know you will not promise.&nbsp; I
would do the same in your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I picked up his keys and presented them to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These keys,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are not so bad after
all; they cannot turn an honest soldier, like you, into a
villainous <i>sgherro</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if I thought they could, I would hand them back to
my superiors, and say, &lsquo;If you will give me no bread but
the wages of a hangman, I will go and beg alms from door to
door.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out his handkerchief, dried his eyes, and then,
raising them, seemed to pray inwardly for some time.&nbsp; I,
too, offered up my secret prayers for this good old man.&nbsp; He
saw it, and took my hand with a look of grateful respect.</p>
<p>Upon leaving me he said, in a low voice, &ldquo;When you speak
with Count Oroboni, speak as I do now.&nbsp; You will do me a
double kindness: I shall hear no more cruel threats of my lord
superintendent, and by not allowing any remarks of yours to be
repeated in his ear, you will avoid giving fresh irritation to
<i>one</i> who knows how to punish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured him that not a word should come from either of our
lips which could possibly give cause of offence.&nbsp; In fact,
we required no further instructions to be cautious.&nbsp; Two
prisoners desirous of communication are skilful enough to invent
a language of their own, without the least danger of its being
interpreted by any listener.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXIX.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> just been taking my
morning&rsquo;s walk; it was the 7th of August.&nbsp;
Oroboni&rsquo;s dungeon door was standing open; Schiller was in
it, and he was not sensible of my approach.&nbsp; My guards
pressed forward in order to close my friend&rsquo;s door, but I
was too quick for them; I darted into the room, and the next
moment found myself in the arms of Count Oroboni.</p>
<p>Schiller was in dismay, and cried out &ldquo;<i>Der
Teufel</i>! <i>der Teufel</i>!&rdquo; most vigorously, at the
same time raising his finger in a threatening attitude.&nbsp; It
was in vain, for his eyes filled with tears, and he cried out,
sobbing, &ldquo;Oh, my God! take pity on these poor young men and
me; on all the unhappy like them, my God, who knows what it is to
be so very unhappy upon earth!&rdquo;&nbsp; The guards, also,
both wept; the sentinel on duty in the gallery ran to the spot,
and even he caught the infection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silvio! Silvio!&rdquo; exclaimed the Count, &ldquo;this
is the most delightful day of my life!&rdquo;&nbsp; I know not
how I answered him; I was nearly distracted with joy and
affection.</p>
<p>When Schiller at length beseeched us to separate, and it was
necessary we should obey, Oroboni burst into a flood of
tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are we never to see each other again upon
earth?&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a wild, prophetic tone.</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; I never saw him more!&nbsp; A very few months
after this parting, his dungeon was empty, and Oroboni lay at
rest in the cemetery, on which I looked out from my window!</p>
<p>From the moment we had met, it seemed as if the tie which
bound us were drawn closer round our hearts; and we were become
still more necessary to each other.</p>
<p>He was a fine young man, with a noble countenance, but pale,
and in poor health.&nbsp; Still, his eyes retained all their
lustre.&nbsp; My affection for him was increased by a knowledge
of his extreme weakness and sufferings.&nbsp; He felt for me in
the same manner; we saw by how frail a tenure hung the lives of
both, and that one must speedily be the survivor.</p>
<p>In a few days he became worse; I could only grieve and pray
for him.&nbsp; After several feverish attacks, he recovered a
little, and was even enabled to resume our conversations.&nbsp;
What ineffable pleasure I experienced on hearing once more the
sound of his voice!&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem glad,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but do not deceive yourself; it is but for a short
time.&nbsp; Have the courage to prepare for my departure, and
your virtuous resolution will inspire me also with
courage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this period the walls of our prison were about to be
whitewashed, and meantime we were to take up our abode in the
caverns below.&nbsp; Unfortunately they placed us in dungeons
apart from each other.&nbsp; But Schiller told me that the Count
was well; though I had my doubts, and dreaded lest his health
should receive a last blow from the effects of his subterranean
abode.&nbsp; If I had only had the good fortune, thought I, to be
near my friend Maroncelli; I could distinguish his voice,
however, as he sung.&nbsp; We spoke to each other, spite of the
shouts and conversation of the guards.&nbsp; At the same period,
the head physician of Br&uuml;nn paid us a visit.&nbsp; He was
sent in consequence of the report made by the superintendent in
regard to the extreme ill health of the prisoners from the scanty
allowance of food.&nbsp; A scorbutic epidemic was already fast
emptying the dungeons.&nbsp; Not aware of the cause of his visit,
I imagined that he came to see Oroboni, and my anxiety was
inexpressible; I was bowed down with sorrow, and I too wished to
die.&nbsp; The thought of suicide again tormented me.&nbsp; I
struggled, indeed; but I felt like the weary traveller, who
though compelled to press forward, feels an almost irresistible
desire to throw himself upon the ground and rest.</p>
<p>I had been just informed that in one of those subterranean
dens an aged Bohemian gentleman had recently destroyed himself by
beating his head against the walls.&nbsp; I wish I had not heard
it; for I could not, do what I would, banish the temptation to
imitate him.&nbsp; It was a sort of delirium, and would most
probably have ended in suicide, had not a violent gush of blood
from my chest, which made me think that death was close at hand,
relieved me.&nbsp; I was thankful to God that it should happen in
this manner, and spare me an act of desperation, which my reason
so strongly condemned.&nbsp; But Providence ordered it otherwise;
I found myself considerably better after the discharge of blood
from my lungs.&nbsp; Meantime, I was removed to the prison above,
and the additional light, with the vicinity of my friend Oroboni,
reconciled me to life.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXX.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">first</span> informed the Count of the
terrific melancholy I had endured when separated from him; and he
declared he had been haunted with a similar temptation to
suicide.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us take advantage,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;of the little time that remains for us, by mutually
consoling each other.&nbsp; We will speak of God; emulate each
other in loving him, and inculcate upon each other that he only
is Justice, Wisdom, Goodness, Beauty&mdash;is all which is most
worthy to be reverenced and adored.&nbsp; I tell you, friend, of
a truth, that death is not far from me.&nbsp; I shall be
eternally grateful, Silvio, if you will help me, in these my last
moments, to become as religious as I ought to have been during my
whole life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now, therefore, confined our conversation wholly to
religious subjects, especially to drawing parallels between the
Christian philosophy and that of mere worldly founders of the
Epicurean schools.&nbsp; We were both delighted to discover so
strict an union between Christianity and reason; and both, on a
comparison of the different evangelical communions, fully agreed
that the catholic was the only one which could successfully
resist the test of criticism,&mdash;which consisted of the purest
doctrines and the purest morality&mdash;not of those wretched
extremes, the product of human ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if by any unexpected accident,&rdquo; observed
Oroboni, &ldquo;we should be restored to society, should we be so
mean-spirited as to shrink from confessing our faith in the
Gospel?&nbsp; Should we stand firm if accused of having changed
our sentiments in consequence of prison discipline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your question, my dear Oroboni,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;acquaints me with the nature of your reply; it is also
mine.&nbsp; The vilest servility is that of being subjected to
the opinions of others, when we feel a persuasion at the same
time that they are false.&nbsp; I cannot believe that either you
or I could be guilty of so much meanness.&rdquo;&nbsp; During
these confidential communications of our sentiments, I committed
one fault.&nbsp; I had pledged my honour to Julian never to
reveal, by mention of his real name, the correspondence which had
passed between us.&nbsp; I informed poor Oroboni of it all,
observing that &ldquo;it never should escape my lips in any other
place; but here we are immured as in a tomb; and even should you
get free, I know I can confide in you as in myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My excellent friend returned no answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why are
you silent?&rdquo; I enquired.&nbsp; He then seriously upbraided
me for having broken my word and betrayed my friend&rsquo;s
secret.&nbsp; His reproach was just; no friendship, however
intimate, however fortified by virtue, can authorise such a
violation of confidence, guaranteed, as it had been, by a sacred
vow.</p>
<p>Since, however, it was done, Oroboni was desirous of turning
my fault to a good account.&nbsp; He was acquainted with Julian,
and related several traits of character, highly honourable to
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;he has so often
acted like a true Christian, that he will never carry his enmity
to such a religion to the grave with him.&nbsp; Let us hope so;
let us not cease to hope.&nbsp; And you, Silvio, try to pardon
his ill-humour from your heart; and pray for him!&rdquo;&nbsp;
His words were held sacred by me.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> conversations of which I speak,
sometimes with Oroboni, and sometimes with Schiller, occupied but
a small portion of the twenty-four hours daily upon my
hands.&nbsp; It was not always, moreover, that I could converse
with Oroboni.&nbsp; How was I to pass the solitary hours?&nbsp; I
was accustomed to rise at dawn, and mounting upon the top of my
table, I grasped the bars of my window, and there said my
prayers.&nbsp; The Count was already at his window, or speedily
followed my example.&nbsp; We saluted each other, and continued
for a time in secret prayer.&nbsp; Horrible as our dungeons were,
they made us more truly sensible of the beauty of the world
without, and the landscape that spread around us.&nbsp; The sky,
the plains, the far off noise and motions of animals in the
valley, the voices of the village maidens, the laugh, the song,
had a charm for us it is difficult to express, and made us more
dearly sensible of the presence of him who is so magnificent in
his goodness, and of whom we ever stand in so much need.</p>
<p>The morning visit of the guards was devoted to an examination
of my dungeon, to see that all was in order.&nbsp; They felt at
my chain, link by link, to be sure that no conspiracy was at
work, or rather in obedience to the laws of discipline which
bound them.&nbsp; If it were the day for the doctor&rsquo;s
visit, Schiller was accustomed to ask us if we wished to see him,
and to make a note to that effect.</p>
<p>The search being over, Schiller made his appearance,
accompanied by Kunda, whose care it was to clean our rooms.&nbsp;
Shortly after he brought our breakfast&mdash;a little pot of
hogwash, and three small slices of coarse bread.&nbsp; The bread
I was able to eat, but could not contrive to drink the swill.</p>
<p>It was next my business to apply to study.&nbsp; Maroncelli
had brought a number of books from Italy, as well as some other
of our fellow-prisoners&mdash;some more, and some less, but
altogether they formed a pretty good library.&nbsp; This, too, we
hoped to enlarge by some purchases; but awaited an answer from
the Emperor, as to whether we might be permitted to read them and
buy others.&nbsp; Meantime the governor gave us permission,
<i>provisionally</i>, to have each two books at a time, and to
exchange them when we pleased.&nbsp; About nine came the
superintendent, and if the doctor had been summoned, he
accompanied him.</p>
<p>I was allowed another interval for study between this and the
dinner hour at eleven.&nbsp; We had then no further visits till
sunset, and I returned to my studies.&nbsp; Schiller and Kunda
then appeared with a change of water, and a moment afterwards,
the superintendent with the guards to make their evening
inspection, never forgetting my chain.&nbsp; Either before or
after dinner, as best pleased the guards, we were permitted in
turn to take our hour&rsquo;s walk.&nbsp; The evening search
being over, Oroboni and I began our conversation,&mdash;always
more extended than at any other hour.&nbsp; The other periods
were, as related in the morning, or directly after
dinner&mdash;but our words were then generally very brief.&nbsp;
At times the sentinels were so kind as to say to us: &ldquo;A
little lower key, gentlemen, or otherwise the punishment will
fall upon us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not unfrequently they would pretend
not to see us, and if the sergeant appeared, begged us to stop
till he were past, when they told us we might talk
again&mdash;&ldquo;But as low as you possibly can, gentlemen, if
you please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nay, it happened that they would quietly accost us themselves;
answer our questions, and give us some information respecting
Italy.</p>
<p>Touching upon some topics, they entreated of us to be silent,
refusing to give any answer.&nbsp; We were naturally doubtful
whether these voluntary conversations, on their part, were really
sincere, or the result of an artful attempt to pry into our
secret opinions.</p>
<p>I am, however, inclined to think that they meant it all in
good part, and spoke to us in perfect kindness and frankness of
heart.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening the sentinels were more
than usually kind and forbearing, and poor Oroboni and I
conversed without in the least suppressing our voices.&nbsp;
Maroncelli, in his subterraneous abode, caught the sound, and
climbing up to the window, listened and distinguished my
voice.&nbsp; He could not restrain his joy; but sung out my name,
with a hearty welcome.&nbsp; He then asked me how I was, and
expressed his regret that he had not yet been permitted to share
the same dungeon.&nbsp; This favour I had, in fact, already
petitioned for, but neither the superintendent nor the governor
had the power of granting it.&nbsp; Our united wishes upon the
same point had been represented to the Emperor, but no answer had
hitherto been received by the governor of Br&uuml;nn.&nbsp;
Besides the instance in which we saluted each other in song, when
in our subterraneous abodes, I had since heard the songs of the
heroic Maroncelli, by fits and starts, in my dungeon above.&nbsp;
He now raised his voice; he was no longer interrupted, and I
caught all he said.&nbsp; I replied, and we continued the
dialogue about a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; Finally, they changed
the sentinels upon the terrace, and the successors were not
&ldquo;of gentle mood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Often did we recommence the
song, and as often were interrupted by furious cries, and curses,
and threats, which we were compelled to obey.</p>
<p>Alas! my fancy often pictured to me the form of my friend,
languishing in that dismal abode so much worse than my own; I
thought of the bitter grief that must oppress him, and the effect
upon his health, and bemoaned his fate in silence.&nbsp; Tears
brought me no relief; the pains in my head returned, with acute
fever.&nbsp; I could no longer stand, and took to my straw
bed.&nbsp; Convulsions came on; the spasms in my breast were
terrible.&nbsp; Of a truth, I believed that that night was my
last.</p>
<p>The following day the fever ceased, my chest was relieved, but
the inflammation seemed to have seized my brain, and I could not
move my head without the most excruciating pain.&nbsp; I informed
Oroboni of my condition; and he too was even worse than
usual.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the
day is near when one or other of us will no longer be able to
reach the window.&nbsp; Each time we welcome one another may be
the last.&nbsp; Let us hold ourselves in readiness, then, to
die&mdash;yes to die! or to survive a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice trembled with emotion; I could not speak a word in
reply.&nbsp; There was a pause, and he then resumed, &ldquo;How
fortunate you are in knowing the German language!&nbsp; You can
at least have the advantage of a priest; I cannot obtain one
acquainted with the Italian.&nbsp; But God is conscious of my
wishes; I made confession at Venice&mdash;and in truth, it does
not seem that I have met with anything since that loads my
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, on the contrary, confessed at Venice,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;with my heart full of rancour, much worse than if I had
wholly refused the sacrament.&nbsp; But if I could find a priest,
I would now confess myself with all my heart, and pardon
everybody, I can assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, Silvio!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you
give me the greatest consolation I can receive.&nbsp; Yes, yes;
dear friend! let us both do all in our power to merit a joyful
meeting where we shall no more be separated, where we shall be
united in happiness, as now we are in these last trying hours of
our calamity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day I expected him as usual at the window.&nbsp; But
he came not, and I learnt from Schiller that he was grievously
ill.&nbsp; In eight or ten days he recovered, and reappeared at
his accustomed station.&nbsp; I complained to him bitterly, but
he consoled me.&nbsp; A few months passed in this strange
alternation of suffering; sometimes it was he, at others I, who
was unable even to reach our window.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXIII.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> enabled to keep up until the
11th of January, 1823.&nbsp; On that morning, I rose with a
slight pain in my head, and a strong tendency to fainting.&nbsp;
My legs trembled, and I could scarcely draw my breath.</p>
<p>Poor Oroboni, also, had been unable to rise from his straw for
several days past.&nbsp; They brought me some soup, I took a
spoonful, and then fell back in a swoon.&nbsp; Some time
afterwards the sentinel in the gallery, happening to look through
the pane of my door, saw me lying senseless on the ground, with
the pot of soup at my side; and believing me to be dead, he
called Schiller, who hastened, as well as the superintendent, to
the spot.</p>
<p>The doctor was soon in attendance, and they put me on my
bed.&nbsp; I was restored with great difficulty.&nbsp; Perceiving
I was in danger, the physician ordered my irons to be taken
off.&nbsp; He then gave me some kind of cordial, but it would not
stay on my stomach, while the pain in my head was horrible.&nbsp;
A report was forthwith sent to the governor, who despatched a
courier to Vienna, to ascertain in what manner I was to be
treated.&nbsp; The answer received, was, that I should not be
placed in the infirmary, but was to receive the same attendance
in my dungeon as was customary in the former place.&nbsp; The
superintendent was further authorised to supply me with soup from
his own kitchen so long as I should continue unwell.</p>
<p>The last provision of the order received was wholly useless,
as neither food nor beverage would stay on my stomach.&nbsp; I
grew worse during a whole week, and was delirious without
intermission, both day and night.</p>
<p>Kral and Kubitzky were appointed to take care of me, and both
were exceedingly attentive.&nbsp; Whenever I showed the least
return of reason, Kral was accustomed to say, &ldquo;There! have
faith in God; God alone is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray for me,&rdquo; I stammered out, when a lucid
interval first appeared; &ldquo;pray for me not to live, but that
he will accept my misfortunes and my death as an
expiation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He suggested that I should take the
sacrament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I asked it not, attribute it to my poor head; it
would be a great consolation to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kral reported my words to the superintendent, and the chaplain
of the prisons came to me.&nbsp; I made my confession, received
the communion, and took the holy oil.&nbsp; The priest&rsquo;s
name was Sturm, and I was satisfied with him.&nbsp; The
reflections he made upon the justice of God, upon the injustice
of man, upon the duty of forgiveness, and upon the vanity of all
earthly things, were not out of place.&nbsp; They bore moreover
the stamp of a dignified and well-cultivated mind as well as an
ardent feeling of true love towards God and our neighbour.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> exertion I made to receive the
sacrament exhausted my remaining strength; but it was of use, as
I fell into a deep sleep, which continued several I hours.</p>
<p>On awaking I felt somewhat refreshed, and observing Schiller
and Kral near me, I took them by the hand, and thanked them for
their care.&nbsp; Schiller fixed his eyes on me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am accustomed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to see persons
at the last, and I would lay a wager that you will not
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not giving me a bad prognostic?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the miseries of life are
great it is true; but he who supports them with dignity and with
humility must always gain something by living.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
then added, &ldquo;If you live, I hope you will some day meet
with consolation you had not expected.&nbsp; You were petitioning
to see your friend Signor Maroncelli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So many times, that I no longer hope for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope, hope, sir; and repeat your request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did so that very day.&nbsp; The superintendent also gave me
hopes; and added, that probably I should not only be permitted to
see him, but that he would attend on me, and most likely become
my undivided companion.</p>
<p>It appeared, that as all the state prisoners had fallen ill,
the governor had requested permission from Vienna to have them
placed two and two, in order that one might assist the other in
case of extreme need.</p>
<p>I had also solicited the favour of writing to my family for
the last time.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the second week, my attack reached its
crisis, and the danger was over.&nbsp; I had begun to sit up,
when one morning my door opened, and the superintendent,
Schiller, and the doctor, all apparently rejoicing, came into my
apartment.&nbsp; The first ran towards me, exclaiming,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got permission for Maroncelli to bear you
company; and you may write to your parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joy deprived me both of breath and speech, and the
superintendent, who in his kindness had not been quite prudent,
believed that he had killed me.&nbsp; On recovering my senses,
and recollecting the good news, I entreated not to have it
delayed.&nbsp; The physician consented, and my friend Maroncelli
was conducted to my bedside.&nbsp; Oh! what a moment was
that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alive?&rdquo; each of us exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my friend, my brother&mdash;what a happy day have
we lived to see!&nbsp; God&rsquo;s name be ever blessed for
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; But our joy was mingled with as deep
compassion.&nbsp; Maroncelli was less surprised upon seeing me,
reduced as I was, for he knew that I had been very ill, but
though aware how <span class="GutSmall">HE</span> must have
suffered, I could not have imagined he would be so extremely
changed.&nbsp; He was hardly to be recognised; his once noble and
handsome features were wholly consumed, as it were, by grief, by
continual hunger, and by the bad air of his dark, subterranean
dungeon.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to see, to hear, and to be near each other was a
great comfort.&nbsp; How much had we to communicate&mdash;to
recollect&mdash;and to talk over!&nbsp; What delight in our
mutual compassion, what sympathy in all our ideas!&nbsp; Then we
were equally agreed upon subjects of religion; to hate only
ignorance and barbarism, but not man, not individuals, and on the
other hand to commiserate the ignorant and the barbarous, and to
pray for their improvement.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXV.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> now presented with a sheet of
paper and ink, in order that I might write to my parents.</p>
<p>As in point of strictness the permission was only given to a
dying man, desirous of bidding a last adieu to his family, I was
apprehensive that the letter being now of different tenour, it
would no longer be sent upon its destination.&nbsp; I confined
myself to the simple duty of beseeching my parents, my brothers,
and my sisters, to resign themselves without a murmur to bear the
lot appointed me, even as I myself was resigned to the will of
God.</p>
<p>This letter was, nevertheless, forwarded, as I subsequently
learnt.&nbsp; It was, in fact, the only one which, during so long
protracted a captivity, was received by my family; the rest were
all detained at Vienna.&nbsp; My companions in misfortune were
equally cut off from all communication with their friends and
families.</p>
<p>We repeatedly solicited that we might be allowed the use of
pen and paper for purposes of study, and that we might purchase
books with our own money.&nbsp; Neither of these petitions was
granted.</p>
<p>The governor, meanwhile, permitted us to read our own books
among each other.&nbsp; We were indebted also to his goodness for
an improvement in our diet; but it did not continue.&nbsp; He had
consented that we should be supplied from the kitchen of the
superintendent instead of that of the contractor; and some fund
had been put apart for that purpose.&nbsp; The order, however,
was not confirmed; but in the brief interval it was in force my
health had greatly improved.&nbsp; It was the same with
Maroncelli; but for the unhappy Oroboni it came too late.&nbsp;
He had received for his companion the advocate Solera, and
afterwards the priest, Dr. Fortini.</p>
<p>We were no sooner distributed through the different prisons
than the prohibition to appear or to converse at our windows was
renewed, with threats that, if detected, the offenders would be
consigned to utter solitude.&nbsp; We often, it is true, broke
through this prison-law, and saluted each other from our windows,
but no longer engaged in long conversations as we had before
done.</p>
<p>In point of disposition, Maroncelli and I were admirably
suited to each other.&nbsp; The courage of the one sustained the
other; if one became violent the other soothed him; if buried in
grief or gloom, he sought to rouse him; and one friendly smile
was often enough to mitigate the severity of our sufferings, and
reconcile each other to life.</p>
<p>So long as we had books, we found them a delightful relief,
not only by reading, but by committing them to memory.&nbsp; We
also examined, compared, criticised, and collated, &amp;c.&nbsp;
We read and we reflected great part of the day in silence, and
reserved the feast of conversation for the hours of dinner, for
our walks, and the evenings.</p>
<p>While in his subterranean abode, Maroncelli had composed a
variety of poems of high merit.&nbsp; He recited them and
produced others.&nbsp; Many of these I committed to memory.&nbsp;
It is astonishing with what facility I was enabled, by this
exercise, to repeat very extensive compositions, to give them
additional polish, and bring them to the highest possible
perfection of which they were susceptible, even had I written
them down with the utmost care.&nbsp; Maroncelli did the same,
and, by degrees, retained by heart many thousand lyric verses,
and epics of different kinds.&nbsp; It was thus, too, I composed
the tragedy of <i>Leoniero da Dertona</i>, and various other
works.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Count Oroboni</span>, after lingering
through a wretched winter and the ensuing spring, found himself
much worse during the summer.&nbsp; He was seized with a spitting
of blood, and a dropsy ensued.&nbsp; Imagine our affliction on
learning that he was dying so near us, without a possibility of
our rendering him the last sad offices, separated only as we were
by a dungeon-wall.</p>
<p>Schiller brought us tidings of him.&nbsp; The unfortunate
young Count, he said, was in the greatest agonies, yet he
retained his admirable firmness of mind.&nbsp; He received the
spiritual consolations of the chaplain, who was fortunately
acquainted with the French language.&nbsp; He died on the 13th of
June, 1823.&nbsp; A few hours before he expired, he spoke of his
aged father, eighty years of age, was much affected, and shed
tears.&nbsp; Then resuming his serenity, he said, &ldquo;But why
thus lament the destiny of the most fortunate of all those so
dear to me; for <i>he</i> is on the eve of rejoining me in the
realms of eternal peace?&rdquo;&nbsp; The last words he uttered,
were, &ldquo;I forgive all my enemies; I do it from my
heart!&rdquo;&nbsp; His eyes were closed by his friend, Dr.
Fortini, a most religious and amiable man, who had been intimate
with him from his childhood.&nbsp; Poor Oroboni! how bitterly we
felt his death when the first sad tidings reached us!&nbsp; Ah!
we heard the voices and the steps of those who came to remove his
body!&nbsp; We watched from our window the hearse, which, slow
and solemnly, bore him to that cemetery within our view.&nbsp; It
was drawn thither by two of the common convicts, and followed by
four of the guards.&nbsp; We kept our eyes fixed upon the
sorrowful spectacle, without speaking a word, till it entered the
churchyard.&nbsp; It passed through, and stopped at last in a
corner, near a new-made grave.&nbsp; The ceremony was brief;
almost immediately the hearse, the convicts, and the guards were
observed to return.&nbsp; One of the last was Kubitzky.&nbsp; He
said to me, &ldquo;I have marked the exact spot where he is
buried, in order that some relation or friend may be enabled some
day to remove his poor bones, and lay them in his own
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a noble thought, and surprised me in
a man so wholly uneducated; but I could not speak.&nbsp; How
often had the unhappy Count gazed from his window upon that
dreary looking cemetery, as he observed, &ldquo;I must try to get
accustomed to the idea of being carried thither; yet I confess
that such an idea makes me shiver.&nbsp; It is strange, but I
cannot help thinking that we shall not rest so well in these
foreign parts as in our own beloved land.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would
then laugh, and exclaim, &ldquo;What childishness is this! when a
garment as worn out, and done with, does it signify where we
throw it aside?&rdquo;&nbsp; At other times, he would say,
&ldquo;I am continually preparing for death, but I should die
more willingly upon one condition&mdash;just to enter my
father&rsquo;s house once more, embrace his knees, hear his voice
blessing me, and die!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then sighed and added,
&ldquo;But if this cup, my God, cannot pass from me, may thy will
be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon the morning of his death he also said,
as he pressed a crucifix, which Kral brought him, to his lips;
&ldquo;Thou, Lord, who wert Divine, hadst also a horror of death,
and didst say, <i>If it be possible</i>, <i>let this cup pass
free me</i>, oh, pardon if I too say it; but I will repeat also
with Thee, Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou willest
it!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the death of Oroboni, I was
again taken ill.&nbsp; I expected very soon to rejoin him, and I
ardently desired it.&nbsp; Still, I could not have parted with
Maroncelli without regret.&nbsp; Often, while seated on his
straw-bed, he read or recited poetry to withdraw my mind, as well
as his own, from reflecting upon our misfortunes, I gazed on him,
and thought with pain, When I am gone, when you see them bearing
me hence, when you gaze at the cemetery, you will look more
sorrowful than now.&nbsp; I would then offer a secret prayer that
another companion might be given him, as capable of appreciating
all his worth.</p>
<p>I shall not mention how many different attacks I suffered, and
with how much difficulty I recovered from them.&nbsp; The
assistance I received from my friend Maroncelli, was like that of
an attached brother.&nbsp; When it became too great an effort for
me to speak, he was silent; he saw the exact moment when his
conversation would soothe or enliven me, he dwelt upon subjects
most congenial to my feelings, and he continued or varied them as
he judged most agreeable to me.&nbsp; Never did I meet with a
nobler spirit; he had few equals, none, whom I knew, superior to
him.&nbsp; Strictly just, tolerant, truly religious, with a
remarkable confidence in human virtue, he added to these
qualities an admirable taste for the beautiful, whether in art or
nature, and a fertile imagination teeming with poetry; in short,
all those engaging dispositions of mind and heart best calculated
to endear him to me.</p>
<p>Still, I could not help grieving over the fate of Oroboni
while, at the same time, I indulged the soothing reflection that
he was freed from all his sufferings, that they were rewarded
with a better world, and that in the midst of the enjoyments he
had won, he must have that of beholding me with a friend no less
attached to me than he had been himself.&nbsp; I felt a secret
assurance that he was no longer in a place of expiation, though I
ceased not to pray for him.&nbsp; I often saw him in my dreams,
and he seemed to pray for me; I tried to think that they were not
mere dreams; that they were manifestations of his blessed spirit,
permitted by God for my consolation.&nbsp; I should not be
believed were I to describe the excessive vividness of such
dreams, if such they were, and the delicious serenity which they
left in my mind for many days after.&nbsp; These, and the
religious sentiments entertained by Maroncelli, with his tried
friendship, greatly alleviated my afflictions.&nbsp; The sole
idea which tormented me was the possibility of this excellent
friend also being snatched from me; his health having been much
broken, so as to threaten his dissolution ere my own sufferings
drew to a close.&nbsp; Every time he was taken ill, I trembled;
and when he felt better, it was a day of rejoicing for me.&nbsp;
Strange, that there should be a fearful sort of pleasure, anxious
yet intense, in these alternations of hope and dread, regarding
the existence of the only object left you on earth.&nbsp; Our lot
was one of the most painful; yet to esteem, to love each other as
we did, was to us a little paradise, the one green spot in the
desert of our lives; it was all we had left, and we bowed our
heads in thankfulness to the Giver of all good, while awaiting
the hour of his summons.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was now my favourite wish that
the chaplain who had attended me in my first illness, might be
allowed to visit us as our confessor.&nbsp; But instead of
complying with our request, the governor sent us an Augustine
friar, called Father Battista, who was to confess us until an
order came from Vienna, either to confirm the choice, or to
nominate another in his place.</p>
<p>I was afraid we might suffer by the change, but was
deceived.&nbsp; Father Battista was an excellent man, highly
educated, of polished manners, and capable of reasoning
admirably, even profoundly, upon the duties of man.&nbsp; We
entreated him to visit us frequently; he came once a month, and
oftener when in his power to do so; he always brought us some
book or other with the governor&rsquo;s permission, and informed
us from the abbot that the entire library of the convent was at
our service.&nbsp; This was a great event for us; and we availed
ourselves of the offer during several months.</p>
<p>After confession, he was accustomed to converse with us and
gave evidence of an upright and elevated mind, capable of
estimating the intrinsic dignity and sanctity of the human
mind.&nbsp; We had the advantage of his enlightened views, of his
affection, and his friendship for us during the space of a
year.&nbsp; At first I confess that I distrusted him, and
imagined that we should soon discover him putting out his feelers
to induce us to make imprudent disclosures.&nbsp; In a prisoner
of state this sort of diffidence is but too natural; but how
great the satisfaction we experience when it disappears, and when
we acknowledge in the interpreter of God no other zeal than that
inspired by the cause of God and of humanity.</p>
<p>He had a most efficacious method of administering
consolation.&nbsp; For instance, I accused myself of flying into
a rage at the rigours imposed upon me by the prison
discipline.&nbsp; He discoursed upon the virtue of suffering with
resignation, and pardoning our enemies; and depicted in lively
colours the miseries of life&mdash;in ranks and conditions
opposite to my own.&nbsp; He had seen much of life, both in
cities and the country, known men of all grades, and deeply
reflected upon human oppression and injustice.&nbsp; He painted
the operation of the passions, and the habits of various social
classes.&nbsp; He described them to me throughout as the strong
and the weak, the oppressors and the oppressed: and the necessity
we were under, either of hating our fellow-man or loving him by a
generous effort of compassion.</p>
<p>The examples he gave to show me the prevailing character of
misfortune in the mass of human beings, and the good which was to
be hence derived, had nothing singular in them; in fact they were
obvious to view; but he recounted them in language so just and
forcible, that I could not but admit the deductions he wished to
draw from them.</p>
<p>The oftener he repeated his friendly reproaches, and has noble
exhortations, the more was I incited to the love of virtue; I no
longer felt capable of resentment&mdash;I could have laid down my
life, with the permission of God, for the least of my
fellow-creatures, and I yet blest His holy name for having
created me&mdash;<span class="smcap">Man</span>!</p>
<p>Wretch that he is who remains ignorant of the sublime duty of
confession!&nbsp; Still more wretched who, to shun the common
herd, as he believes, feels himself called upon to regard it with
scorn!&nbsp; Is it not a truth that even when we know what is
required of us to be good, that self-knowledge is a dead letter
to us? reading and reflection are insufficient to impel us to it;
it is only the living speech of a man gifted with power which can
here be of avail.&nbsp; The soul is shaken to its centre, the
impressions it receives are more profound and lasting.&nbsp; In
the brother who speaks to you, there is a life, and a living and
breathing spirit&mdash;one which you can always consult, and
which you will vainly seek for, either in books or in your own
thoughts.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the beginning of 1824 the
superintendent who had his office at one end of our gallery,
removed elsewhere, and the chambers, along with others, were
converted into additional prisons.&nbsp; By this, alas, we were
given to understand that other prisoners of state were expected
from Italy.</p>
<p>They arrived in fact very shortly&mdash;a third special
commission was at hand&mdash;and they were all in the circle of
my friends or my acquaintance.&nbsp; What was my grief when I was
told their names!&nbsp; Borsieri was one of my oldest
friends.&nbsp; To Confalonieri I had been attached a less time
indeed, but not the less ardently.&nbsp; Had it been in my power,
by taking upon myself the <i>carcere durissimo</i>, or any other
imaginable torment, how willingly would I have purchased their
liberation.&nbsp; Not only would I have laid down my life for
them,&mdash;for what is it to give one&rsquo;s life? I would have
continued to suffer for them.</p>
<p>It was then I wished to obtain the consolations of Father
Battista; but they would not permit him to come near me.</p>
<p>New orders to maintain the severest discipline were received
from Vienna.&nbsp; The terrace on which we walked was hedged in
by stockades, and in such a way that no one, even with the use of
a telescope, could perceive our movements.&nbsp; We could no
longer catch the beautiful prospect of the surrounding hills, and
part of the city of Br&uuml;nn which lay below.&nbsp; Yet this
was not enough.&nbsp; To reach the terrace, we were obliged, as
before stated, to traverse the courtyard, and a number of persons
could perceive us.&nbsp; That we might be concealed from every
human eye, we were prohibited from crossing it, and we were
confined in our walk to a small passage close to our gallery,
with a north aspect similar to that of our dungeons.</p>
<p>To us such a change was a real misfortune, and it grieved
us.&nbsp; There were innumerable little advantages and
refreshments to our worn and wasted spirits in the walk of which
we were deprived.&nbsp; The sight of the superintendent&rsquo;s
children; their smiles and caresses; the scene where I had taken
leave of their mother; the occasional chit-chat with the old
smith, who had his forge there; the joyous songs of one of the
captains accompanied by his guitar; and last not least, the
innocent badinage of a young Hungarian fruiteress&mdash;the
corporal&rsquo;s wife, who flirted with my companions&mdash;were
among what we had lost.&nbsp; She had, in fact, taken a great
fancy for Maroncelli.</p>
<p>Previous to his becoming my companion, he had made a little of
her acquaintance; but was so sincere, so dignified, and so simple
in his intentions as to be quite insensible of the impression he
had produced.&nbsp; I informed him of it, and he would not
believe I was serious, though he declared that he would take care
to preserve a greater distance.&nbsp; Unluckily the more he was
reserved, the more did the lady&rsquo;s fancy for him seemed to
increase.</p>
<p>It so happened that her window was scarcely above a yard
higher than the level of the terrace; and in an instant she was
at our side with the apparent intention of putting out some linen
to dry, or to perform some other household offices; but in fact
to gaze at my friend, and, if possible, enter into conversation
with him.</p>
<p>Our poor guards, half wearied to death for want of sleep, had,
meantime, eagerly caught at an opportunity of throwing themselves
on the grass, just in this corner, where they were no longer
under the eye of their superiors.&nbsp; They fell asleep; and
meanwhile Maroncelli was not a little perplexed what to do, such
was the resolute affection borne him by the fair Hungarian.&nbsp;
I was no less puzzled; for an affair of the kind, which,
elsewhere, might have supplied matter for some merriment, was
here very serious, and might lead to some very unpleasant
result.&nbsp; The unhappy cause of all this had one of those
countenances which tell you at once their character&mdash;the
habit of being virtuous, and the necessity of being
esteemed.&nbsp; She was not beautiful, but had a remarkable
expression of elegance in her whole manner and deportment; her
features, though not regular, fascinated when she smiled, and
with every change of sentiment.</p>
<p>Were it my purpose to dwell upon love affairs, I should have
no little to relate respecting this virtuous but unfortunate
woman&mdash;now deceased.&nbsp; Enough that I have alluded to one
of the few adventures which marked my prison-hours.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> increasing rigour of our prison
discipline rendered our lives one unvaried scene.&nbsp; The whole
of 1824, of 1825, of 1826, of 1827, presented the same dull, dark
aspect; and how we lived through years like these is
wonderful.&nbsp; We were forbidden the use of books.&nbsp; The
prison was one immense tomb, though without the peace and
unconsciousness of death.&nbsp; The director of police came every
month to institute the most strict and minute search, assisted by
a lieutenant and guards.&nbsp; They made us strip to the skin,
examined the seams of our garments, and ripped up the straw
bundles called our beds in pursuit of&mdash;nothing.&nbsp; It was
a secret affair, intended to take us by surprise, and had
something about it which always irritated me exceedingly, and
left me in a violent fever.</p>
<p>The preceding years had appeared to me very unhappy, yet I now
remembered them with regret.&nbsp; The hours were fled when I
could read my Bible, and Homer, from whom I had imbibed such a
passionate admiration of his glorious language.&nbsp; Oh, how it
irked me to be unable to prosecute my study of him!&nbsp; And
there were Dante, Petrarch, Shakespeare, Byron, Walter Scott,
Schiller, Goethe, &amp;c.&mdash;how many friends, how many
innocent and true delights were withheld from me.&nbsp; Among
these I included a number of works, also, upon Christian
knowledge; those of Bourdaloue, Pascal, &ldquo;The Imitation of
Christ,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Filotea,&rdquo; &amp;c., books usually
read with narrow, illiberal views by those who exult in every
little defect of taste, and at every common-place thought which
impels the reader to throw them for ever aside; but which, when
perused in a true spirit free from scandalous or malignant
construction, discover a mine of deep philosophy, and vigorous
nutriment both for the intellect and the heart.&nbsp; A few of
certain religious books, indeed, were sent us, as a present, by
the Emperor, but with an absolute prohibition to receive works of
any other kind adapted for literary occupation.</p>
<p>This imperial gift of ascetic productions arrived in 1825 by a
Dalmatian Confessor, Father Stefano Paulowich, afterwards Bishop
of Cattaro, who was purposely sent from Vienna.&nbsp; We were
indebted to him for performing mass, which had been before
refused us, on the plea that they could not convey us into the
church and keep us separated into two and two as the imperial law
prescribed.&nbsp; To avoid such infraction we now went to mass in
three groups; one being placed upon the tribune of the organ,
another under the tribune, so as not to be visible, and the third
in a small oratory, from which was a view into the church through
a grating.&nbsp; On this occasion Maroncelli and I had for
companions six convicts, who had received sentence before we
came, but no two were allowed to speak to any other two in the
group.&nbsp; Two of them, I found, had been my neighbours in the
Piombi at Venice.</p>
<p>We were conducted by the guards to the post assigned us, and
then brought back after mass in the same manner, each couple into
their former dungeon.&nbsp; A Capuchin friar came to celebrate
mass; the good man ended every rite with a &ldquo;let us
pray&rdquo; for &ldquo;liberation from chains,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;to set the prisoner free,&rdquo; in a voice which trembled
with emotion.</p>
<p>On leaving the altar he cast a pitying look on each of the
three groups, and bowed his head sorrowfully in secret
prayer.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1825 Schiller was pronounced
past his service from infirmity and old age; though put in guard
over some other prisoners, not thought to require equal vigilance
and care.&nbsp; It was a trying thing to part from him, and he
felt it as well as we.&nbsp; Kral, a man not inferior to him in
good disposition, was at first his successor.&nbsp; But he too
was removed, and we had a jailer of a very harsh and distant
manner, wholly devoid of emotion, though not intrinsically
bad.</p>
<p>I felt grieved; Schiller, Kral, and Kubitzky, but in
particular the two former, had attended us in our extreme
sufferings with the affection of a father or a brother.&nbsp;
Though incapable of violating their trust, they knew how to do
their duty without harshness of any kind.&nbsp; If there were
something hard in the forms, they took the sting out of them as
much as possible by various ingenious traits and turns of a
benevolent mind.&nbsp; I was sometimes angry at them, but they
took all I said in good part.&nbsp; They wished us to feel that
they had become attached to us; and they rejoiced when we
expressed as much, and approved of anything they did.</p>
<p>From the time Schiller left us, he was frequently ill; and we
inquired after him with a sort of filial anxiety.&nbsp; When he
sufficiently recovered, he was in the habit of coming to walk
under our windows; we hailed him, and he would look up with a
melancholy smile, at the same time addressing the sentinels in a
voice we could overhear: &ldquo;<i>Da sind meine Sohne</i>! there
are my sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor old man! how sorry I was to see him almost staggering
along, with the weight of increasing infirmities, so near us, and
without being enabled to offer him even my arm.</p>
<p>Sometimes he would sit down upon the grass, and read.&nbsp;
They were the same books he had often lent me.&nbsp; To please
me, he would repeat the titles to the sentinels, or recite some
extract from them, and then look up at me, and nod.&nbsp; After
several attacks of apoplexy, he was conveyed to the military
hospital, where in a brief period he died.&nbsp; He left some
hundreds of florins, the fruit of long savings.&nbsp; These he
had already lent, indeed, to such of his old military comrades as
most required them; and when he found his end approaching, he
called them all to his bedside, and said: &ldquo;I have no
relations left; I wish each of you to keep what I have lent you,
for my sake.&nbsp; I only ask that you will pray for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of these friends had a daughter of about eighteen, and who
was Schiller&rsquo;s god-daughter.&nbsp; A few hours before his
death, the good old man sent for her.&nbsp; He could not speak
distinctly, but he took a silver ring from his finger, and placed
it upon hers.&nbsp; He then kissed her, and shed tears over
her.&nbsp; The poor girl sobbed as if her heart would break, for
she was tenderly attached to him.&nbsp; He took a handkerchief,
and, as if trying to soothe her, he dried her eyes.&nbsp; Lastly,
he took hold of her hands, and placed them upon his eyes; and
those eyes were closed for ever.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> human consolations were one by
one fast deserting us, and our sufferings still increased.&nbsp;
I resigned myself to the will of God, but my spirit
groaned.&nbsp; It seemed as if my mind, instead of becoming
inured to evil, grew more keenly susceptible of pain.&nbsp; One
day there was secretly brought to me a page of the Augsburgh
Gazette, in which I found the strangest assertions respecting
myself on occasion of mention being made of one of my sisters
retiring into a nunnery.&nbsp; It stated as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The Signora Maria Angiola Pellico,
daughter, &amp;c., took the veil (on such a day) in the monastery
of the Visitazione at Turin, &amp;c.&nbsp; This lady is sister to
the author of <i>Francesca da Rimini</i>, Silvio Pellico, who was
recently liberated from the fortress of Spielberg, being pardoned
by his Majesty, the emperor&mdash;a trait of clemency worthy of
so magnanimous a sovereign, and a subject of gratulation to the
whole of Italy, inasmuch as,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>And here followed some eulogiums which I omit.&nbsp; I could
not conceive for what reason the hoax relating to the gracious
pardon had been invented.&nbsp; It seemed hardly probable it
could be a mere freak of the editor&rsquo;s; and was it then
intended as some stroke of oblique German policy?&nbsp; Who
knows!&nbsp; However this may be, the names of Maria Angiola were
precisely those of my younger sister, and doubtless they must
have been copied from the Turin Gazette into other papers.&nbsp;
Had that excellent girl, then, really become a nun?&nbsp; Had she
taken this step in consequence of the loss of her parents?&nbsp;
Poor Maria! she would not permit me alone to suffer the
deprivations of a prison; she too would seclude herself from the
world.&nbsp; May God grant her patience and self-denial, far
beyond what I have evinced; for often I know will that angel, in
her solitary cell, turn her thoughts and her prayers towards
me.&nbsp; Alas, it may be, she will impose on herself some rigid
penance, in the hope that God may alleviate the sufferings of her
brother!&nbsp; These reflections agitated me greatly, and my
heart bled.&nbsp; Most likely my own misfortunes had helped to
shorten the days both of my father and my mother; for, were they
living, it would be hardly possible that my Marietta would have
deserted our parental roof.&nbsp; At length the idea oppressed me
with the weight of absolute certainty, and I fell into a wretched
and agonised state of mind.&nbsp; Maroncelli was no less affected
than myself.&nbsp; The next day he composed a beautiful elegy
upon &ldquo;the sister of the prisoner.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he had
completed it, he read it to me.&nbsp; How grateful was I for such
a proof of his affection for me!&nbsp; Among the infinite number
of poems which had been written upon similar subjects, not one,
probably, had been composed in prison, for the brother of the
nun, and by his companion in captivity and chains.&nbsp; What a
field for pathetic and religious ideas was here, and Maroncelli
filled his lyre with wild and pathetic tones, which drew
delicious tears from my eyes.</p>
<p>It was thus friendship sweetened all my woes.&nbsp; Seldom
from that day did I forget to turn my thoughts long and fondly to
some sacred asylum of virgin hearts, and that one beloved form
did not rise before my fancy, dressed in all that human piety and
love can picture in a brother&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Often did I
beseech Heaven to throw a charm round her religious solitude, and
not permit that her imagination should paint in too horrible
colours the sufferings of the sick and weary captive.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reader must not suppose from
the circumstance of my seeing the Gazette, that I was in the
habit of hearing news, or could obtain any.&nbsp; No! though all
the agents employed around me were kind, the system was such as
to inspire the utmost terror.&nbsp; If there occurred the least
clandestine proceeding, it was only when the danger was not
felt&mdash;when not the least risk appeared.&nbsp; The extreme
rareness of any such occurrences may be gathered from what has
been stated respecting the ordinary and extraordinary searches
which took place, morning, noon, and night, through every corner
of our dungeons.</p>
<p>I had never a single opportunity of receiving any notice,
however slight, regarding my family, even by secret means, beyond
the allusions in the Gazette to my sister and myself.&nbsp; The
fears I entertained lest my dear parents no longer survived were
greatly augmented, soon after, by the manner in which the police
director came to inform me that my relatives were well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Majesty the Emperor,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;commands me to communicate to you good tidings of your
relations at Turin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not express my pleasure and my surprise at this
unexpected circumstance; but I soon put a variety of questions to
him as to their health: &ldquo;Left you my parents, brothers, and
sisters, at Turin? are they alive? if you have any letter from
them pray let me have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can show you nothing.&nbsp; You must be
satisfied.&nbsp; It is a mark of the Emperor&rsquo;s clemency to
let you know even so much.&nbsp; The same favour is not shown to
every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grant it is a proof of the Emperor&rsquo;s kindness;
but you will allow it to be impossible for me to derive the least
consolation from information like this.&nbsp; Which of my
relations are well? have I lost no one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, sir, that I cannot state more than I have
been directed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he retired.</p>
<p>It must assuredly have been intended to console me by this
indefinite allusion to my family.&nbsp; I felt persuaded that the
Emperor had yielded to the earnest petition of some of my
relatives to permit me to hear tidings of them, and that I was
permitted to receive no letter in order to remain in the dark as
to which of my dear family were now no more.&nbsp; I was the more
confirmed in this supposition from the fact of receiving a
similar communication a few months subsequently; but there was no
letter, no further news.</p>
<p>It was soon perceived that so far from having been productive
of satisfaction to me, such meagre tidings had thrown me into
still deeper affliction, and I heard no more of my beloved
family.&nbsp; The continual suspense, the distracting idea that
my parents were dead, that my brothers also might be no more,
that my sister Giuseppina was gone, and that Marietta was the
sole survivor, and that in the agony of her sorrow she had thrown
herself into a convent, there to close her unhappy days, still
haunted my imagination, and completely alienated me from
life.</p>
<p>Not unfrequently I had fresh attacks of the terrible disorders
under which I had before suffered, with those of a still more
painful kind, such as violent spasms of the stomach, exactly like
<i>cholera morbus</i>, from the effects of which I hourly
expected to die.&nbsp; Yes! and I fervently hoped and prayed that
all might soon be over.</p>
<p>At the same time, nevertheless, whenever I cast a pitying
glance at my no less weak and unfortunate companion&mdash;such is
the strange contradiction of our nature&mdash;I felt my heart
inly bleed at the idea of leaving him, a solitary prisoner, in
such an abode; and again I wished to live.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Thrice</span>, during my incarceration at
Spielberg, there arrived persons of high rank to inspect the
dungeons, and ascertain that there was no abuse of
discipline.&nbsp; The first visitor was the Baron Von M&uuml;nch,
who, struck with compassion on seeing us so sadly deprived of
light and air, declared that he would petition in our favour, to
have a lantern placed over the outside of the pane in our dungeon
doors, through which the sentinels could at any moment perceive
us.&nbsp; His visit took place in 1825, and a year afterwards his
humane suggestion was put in force.&nbsp; By this sepulchral
light we could just catch a view of the walls, and prevent our
knocking our heads in trying to walk.&nbsp; The second visit was
that of the Baron Von Vogel.&nbsp; He found me in a lamentable
state of health; and learning that the physician had declared
that coffee would be very good for me, and that I could not
obtain it, as being too great a luxury, he interested himself for
me, and my old, delightful beverage, was ordered to be brought
me.&nbsp; The third visit was from a lord of the court, with
whose name I am not acquainted, between fifty and sixty years of
age, and who, by his manners as well as his words, testified the
sincerest compassion for us; at the same time lamenting that he
could do nothing for us.&nbsp; Still, the expression of his
sympathy&mdash;for he was really affected&mdash;was something,
and we were grateful for it.</p>
<p>How strange, how irresistible, is the desire of the solitary
prisoner to behold some one of his own species!&nbsp; It amounts
almost to a sort of instinct, as if in order to avoid insanity,
and its usual consequence, the tendency to
self-destruction.&nbsp; The Christian religion, so abounding in
views of humanity, forgets not to enumerate amongst its works of
mercy the visiting of the prisoner.&nbsp; The mere aspect of man,
his look of commiseration, and his willingness, as it were, to
share with you, and bear a part of your heavy burden, even when
you know he cannot relieve you, has something that sweetens your
bitter cup.</p>
<p>Perfect solitude is doubtless of advantage to some minds, but
far more so if not carried to an extreme, and relieved by some
little intercourse with society.&nbsp; Such at least is my
constitution.&nbsp; If I do not behold my fellow-men, my
affections become restricted to too confined a circle, and I
begin to dislike all others; while, if I continue in
communication with an ordinary number, I learn to regard the
whole of mankind with affection.</p>
<p>Innumerable times, I am sorry to confess, I have been so
exclusively occupied with a few, and so averse to the many, as to
be almost terrified at the feelings I experienced.&nbsp; I would
then approach the window, desirous of catching some new features,
and thought myself happy when the sentinel passed not too closely
to the wall, if I got a single glance of him, or if he lifted up
his head upon hearing me cough&mdash;more especially if he had a
good-natured countenance; when he showed the least feeling of
pity, I felt a singular emotion of pleasure, as if that unknown
soldier had been one of my intimate friends.</p>
<p>If, the next time, he passed by in a manner that prevented my
seeing him, or took no notice of me, I felt as much mortified as
some poor lover, when he finds that the beloved object wholly
neglects him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the adjoining prison, once
occupied by Oroboni, D. Marco Fortini and Antonio Villa were now
confined.&nbsp; The latter, once as strong as Hercules, was
nearly famished the first year, and when a better allowance was
granted he had wholly lost the power of digestion.&nbsp; He
lingered a long time, and when reduced almost to the last
extremity, he was removed into a somewhat more airy prison.&nbsp;
The pestilential atmosphere of these narrow receptacles, so much
resembling real tombs, was doubtless very injurious to others as
well as to him.&nbsp; But the remedy sought for was too late or
insufficient to remove the cause of his sufferings.&nbsp; He had
scarcely been a month in this spacious prison, when, in
consequence of bursting several blood-vessels, and his previously
broken health, he died.</p>
<p>He was attended by his fellow-prisoner, D. Fortini, and by the
Abate Paulowich, who hastened from Vienna upon hearing that he
was dying.&nbsp; Although I had not been on the same intimate
terms with him as with Count Oroboni, his death a good deal
affected me.&nbsp; He had parents and a wife, all most tenderly
attached to him.&nbsp; <i>He</i>, indeed, was more to be envied
than regretted; but, alas, for the unhappy survivors to whom he
was everything!&nbsp; He had, moreover, been my neighbour when
under the <i>Piombi</i>.&nbsp; Tremerello had brought me several
of his poetical pieces, and had conveyed to him some lines from
me in return.&nbsp; There was sometimes a depth of sentiment and
pathos in his poems which interested me.&nbsp; I seemed to become
still more attached to him after he was gone; learning, as I did
from the guards, how dreadfully he had suffered.&nbsp; It was
with difficulty, though truly religious, that he could resign
himself to die.&nbsp; He experienced to the utmost the horror of
that final step, while he blessed the name of the Lord, and
called upon His name with tears streaming from his eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot conform my will unto
thine, yet how willingly would I do it; do thou work this happy
change in me!&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not possess the same courage as
Oroboni, but followed his example in forgiving all his
enemies.</p>
<p>At the close of the year (1826) we one evening heard a
suppressed noise in the gallery, as if persons were stealing
along.&nbsp; Our hearing had become amazingly acute in
distinguishing different kinds of noises.&nbsp; A door was
opened; and we knew it to be that of the advocate Solera.&nbsp;
Another! it was that of Fortini!&nbsp; There followed a
whispering, but we could tell the voice of the police director,
suppressed as it was.&nbsp; What could it be? a search at so late
an hour! and for what reason?</p>
<p>In a brief space, we heard steps again in the gallery; and ah!
more plainly we recognised the voice of our excellent Fortini:
&ldquo;Unfortunate as I am! excuse it? go out!&nbsp; I have
forgotten a volume of my breviary!&rdquo;&nbsp; And we then heard
him run back to fetch the book mentioned, and rejoin the
police.&nbsp; The door of the staircase opened, and we heard them
go down.&nbsp; In the midst of our alarm we learnt that our two
good friends had just received a pardon; and although we
regretted we could not follow them, we rejoiced in their
unexpected good fortune.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> liberation of our two
companions brought no alteration in the discipline observed
towards us.&nbsp; Why, we asked ourselves, were they set at
liberty, condemned as they had been, like us, the one to twenty,
the other to fifteen years&rsquo; imprisonment, while no sort of
favour was shown to the rest?</p>
<p>Were the suspicions against those who were still consigned to
captivity more strong, or did the disposition to pardon the
whole, at brief intervals of time, and two together, really
exist?&nbsp; We continued in suspense for some time.&nbsp;
Upwards of three months elapsed, and we heard of no fresh
instances of pardon.&nbsp; Towards the end of 1827, we considered
that December might be fixed on as the anniversary of some new
liberations; but the month expired, and nothing of the kind
occurred.</p>
<p>Still we indulged the expectation until the summer of 1828,
when I had gone through seven years and a half of my
punishment&mdash;equivalent, according to the Emperor&rsquo;s
declaration, to the fifteen, if the infliction of it were to be
dated from the term of my arrest.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, it
were to be calculated, not from the period of my trial, as was
most probable, but from that of the publication of my sentence,
the seven years and a half would only be completed in 1829.</p>
<p>Yet all these periods passed over, and there was no appearance
of a remittance of punishment.&nbsp; Meantime, even before the
liberation of Solera and Fortini, Maroncelli was ill with a bad
tumour upon his knee.&nbsp; At first the pain was not great, and
he only limped as he walked.&nbsp; It then grew very irksome to
him to bear his irons, and he rarely went out to walk.&nbsp; One
autumnal morning he was desirous of breathing the fresh air;
there was a fall of snow, and unfortunately in walking his leg
failed him, and he came to the ground.&nbsp; This accident was
followed by acute pain in his knee.&nbsp; He was carried to his
bed; for he was no longer able to remain in an upright
position.&nbsp; When the physician came, he ordered his irons to
be taken off; but the swelling increased to an enormous size, and
became more painful every day.&nbsp; Such at length were the
sufferings of my unhappy friend, that he could obtain no rest
either in bed or out of it.&nbsp; When compelled to move about,
to rise or to lie down, it was necessary to take hold of the bad
leg and carry it as he went with the utmost care; and the most
trifling motion brought on the most severe pangs.&nbsp; Leaches,
baths, caustics, and fomentations of different kinds, were all
found ineffectual, and seemed only to aggravate his
torments.&nbsp; After the use of caustics, suppuration followed;
the tumour broke out into wounds, but even these failed to bring
relief to the suffering patient.</p>
<p>Maroncelli was thus far more unfortunate than myself, although
my sympathy for him caused me real pain and suffering, I was
glad, however, to be near him, to attend to all his wants, and to
perform all the duties of a brother and a friend.&nbsp; It soon
became evident that his leg would never heal: he considered his
death as near at hand, and yet he lost nothing of his admirable
calmness or his courage.&nbsp; The sight of his sufferings at
last was almost more than I could bear.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Still</span>, in this deplorable
condition, he continued to compose verses, he sang, and he
conversed; and all this he did to encourage me, by disguising
from me a part of what he suffered.&nbsp; He lost his powers of
digestion, he could not sleep, was reduced to a skeleton, and
very frequently swooned away.&nbsp; Yet the moment he was
restored he rallied his spirits, and, smiling, bade me be not
afraid.&nbsp; It is indescribable what he suffered during many
months.&nbsp; At length a consultation was to be held; the head
physician was called in, approved of all his colleague had done,
and, without expressing a decisive opinion, took his leave.&nbsp;
A few minutes after, the superintendent entered, and addressing
Maroncelli,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The head physician did not venture to express his real
opinion in your presence; he feared you would not have fortitude
to bear so terrible an announcement.&nbsp; I have assured him,
however, that you are possessed of courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; replied Maroncelli, &ldquo;that I have
given some proof of it in bearing this dreadful torture without
howling out.&nbsp; Is there anything he would propose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, the amputation of the limb: only perceiving
how much your constitution is broken down, he hesitates to advise
you.&nbsp; Weak as you are, could you support the operation? will
you run the risk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of dying? and shall I not equally die if I go on,
without ending this diabolical torture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will send off an account, then, direct to Vienna,
soliciting permission, and the moment it comes you shall have
your leg cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! does it require a <i>permit</i> for
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, sir,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>In about a week a courier arrived from Vienna with the
expected news.</p>
<p>My sick friend was carried from his dungeon into a larger
room, for permission to have his leg cut off had just
arrived.&nbsp; He begged me to follow him: &ldquo;I may die under
the knife, and I should wish, in that case, to expire in your
arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; I promised, and was permitted to accompany
him.&nbsp; The sacrament was first administered to the unhappy
prisoner, and we then quietly awaited the arrival of the
surgeons.&nbsp; Maroncelli filled up the interval by singing a
hymn.&nbsp; At length they came; one was an able surgeon, to
superintend the operation, from Vienna; but it was the privilege
of our ordinary prison apothecary, and he would not yield to the
man of science, who must be contented to look on.&nbsp; The
patient was placed on the side of a couch; with his leg down,
while I supported him in my arms.&nbsp; It was to be cut above
the knee; first, an incision was made, the depth of an
inch&mdash;then through the muscles&mdash;and the blood flowed in
torrents: the arteries were next taken up with ligatures, one by
one.&nbsp; Next came the saw.&nbsp; This lasted some time, but
Maroncelli never uttered a cry.&nbsp; When he saw them carrying
his leg away, he cast on it one melancholy look, then turning
towards the surgeon, he said, &ldquo;You have freed me from an
enemy, and I have no money to give you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saw a
rose, in a glass, placed in a window: &ldquo;May I beg of you to
bring me hither that flower?&rdquo;&nbsp; I brought it to him;
and he then offered it to the surgeon with an indescribable air
of good-nature: &ldquo;See, I have nothing else to give you in
token of my gratitude.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took it as it was meant,
and even wiped away a tear.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> surgeons had supposed that the
hospital of Spielberg would provide all that was requisite except
the instruments, which they brought with them.&nbsp; But after
the amputation, it was found that a number of things were
wanting; such as linen, ice, bandages, &amp;c.&nbsp; My poor
friend was thus compelled to wait two hours before these articles
were brought from the city.&nbsp; At length he was laid upon his
bed, and the ice applied to the trunk of the bleeding
thigh.&nbsp; Next day it was dressed; but the patient was allowed
to take no nourishment beyond a little broth, with an egg.&nbsp;
When the risk of fever was over, he was permitted the use of
restoratives; and an order from the Emperor directed that he
should be supplied from the table of the superintendent till he
was better.</p>
<p>The cure was completed in about forty days, after which we
were conducted into our dungeon.&nbsp; This had been enlarged for
us; that is, an opening was made in the wall so as to unite our
old den to that once occupied by Oroboni, and subsequently by
Villa.&nbsp; I placed my bed exactly in the same spot where
Oroboni had died, and derived a mournful pleasure from thus
approaching my friend, as it were, as nearly as possible.&nbsp;
It appeared as if his spirit still hovered round me, and consoled
me with manifestations of more than earthly love.</p>
<p>The horrible sight of Maroncelli&rsquo;s sufferings, both
before and subsequently to the amputation of his leg, had done
much to strengthen my mind.&nbsp; During the whole period, my
health had enabled me to attend upon him, and I was grateful to
God; but from the moment my friend assumed his crutches, and
could supply his own wants, I began daily to decline.&nbsp; I
suffered extremely from glandular swellings, and those were
followed by pains of the chest, more oppressive than I had before
experienced, attended with dizziness and spasmodic
dysentery.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is my turn now,&rdquo; thought I;
&ldquo;shall I show less patience than my companion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every condition of life has its duties; and those of the sick
consist of patience, courage, and continual efforts to appear not
unamiable to the persons who surround them.&nbsp; Maroncelli, on
his crutches, no longer possessed the same activity, and was
fearful of not doing everything for me of which I stood in
need.&nbsp; It was in fact the case, but I did all to prevent his
being made sensible of it.&nbsp; Even when he had recovered his
strength he laboured under many inconveniences.&nbsp; He
complained, like most others after a similar operation, of acute
pains in the nerves, and imagined that the part removed was still
with him.&nbsp; Sometimes it was the toe, sometimes the leg, and
at others the knee of the amputated limb which caused him to cry
out.&nbsp; The bone, moreover, had been badly sawed, and pushed
through the newly-formed flesh, producing frequent wounds.&nbsp;
It required more than a year to bring the stump to a good state,
when at length it hardened and broke out no more.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">New</span> evils, however, soon assailed
my unhappy friend.&nbsp; One of the arteries, beginning at the
joints of the hand, began to pain him, extending to other parts
of his body; and then turned into a scorbutic sore.&nbsp; His
whole person became covered with livid spots, presenting a
frightful spectacle.&nbsp; I tried to reconcile myself to it, by
considering that since it appeared we were to die here, it was
better that one of us should be seized with the scurvy; it is a
contagious disease, and must carry us off either together, or at
a short interval from each other.&nbsp; We both prepared
ourselves for death, and were perfectly tranquil.&nbsp; Nine
years&rsquo; imprisonment, and the grievous sufferings we had
undergone, had at length familiarised us to the idea of the
dissolution of two bodies so totally broken and in need of
peace.&nbsp; It was time the scene should close, and we confided
in the goodness of God, that we should be reunited in a place
where the passions of men should cease, and where, we prayed, in
spirit and in truth, that those who <span class="GutSmall">DID
NOT LOVE US</span> might meet us in peace, in a kingdom where
only one Master, the supreme King of kings, reigned for
evermore.</p>
<p>This malignant distemper had destroyed numbers of prisoners
during the preceding years.&nbsp; The governor, upon learning
that Maroncelli had been attacked by it, agreed with the
physician, that the sole hope of remedy was in the fresh
air.&nbsp; They were afraid of its spreading; and Maroncelli was
ordered to be as little as possible within his dungeon.&nbsp;
Being his companion, and also unwell, I was permitted the same
privilege.&nbsp; We were permitted to be in the open air the
whole time the other prisoners were absent from the walk, during
two hours early in the morning, during the dinner, if we
preferred it, and three hours in the evening, even after
sunset.</p>
<p>There was one other unhappy patient, about seventy years of
age, and in extremely bad health, who was permitted to bear us
company.&nbsp; His name was Constantino Munari; he was of an
amiable disposition, greatly attached to literature and
philosophy, and agreeable in conversation.</p>
<p>Calculating my imprisonment, not from my arrest, but from the
period of receiving my sentence, I had been seven years and a
half (in the year 1829), according to the imperial decree, in
different dungeons; and about nine from the day of my
arrest.&nbsp; But this term, like the other, passed over, and
there was no sign of remitting my punishment.</p>
<p>Up to the half of the whole term, my friend Maroncelli,
Munari, and I had indulged the idea of a possibility of seeing
once more our native land and our relations; and we frequently
conversed with the warmest hopes and feelings upon the
subject.&nbsp; August, September, and the whole of that year
elapsed, and then we began to despair; nothing remained to
relieve our destiny but our unaltered attachment for each other,
and the support of religion, to enable us to close our latter
prison hours with becoming dignity and resignation.&nbsp; It was
then we felt the full value of friendship and religion, which
threw a charm even over the darkness of our lot.&nbsp; Human
hopes and promises had failed us; but God never forsakes the
mourners and the captives who truly love and fear Him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XC.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the death of Villa, the Abate
Wrba was appointed our confessor, on occasion of the Abate
Paulowich receiving a bishopric.&nbsp; He was a Moravian,
professor of the gospel at Br&uuml;nn, and an able pupil of the
Sublime Institute of Vienna.&nbsp; This was founded by the
celebrated Frinl, then chaplain to the court.&nbsp; The members
of the congregation are all priests, who, though already masters
of theology, prosecute their studies under the Institution with
the severest discipline.&nbsp; The views of the founder were
admirable, being directed to the continual and general
dissemination of true and profound science, among the Catholic
clergy of Germany.&nbsp; His plans were for the most part
successful, and are yet in extensive operation.</p>
<p>Being resident at Br&uuml;nn, Wrba could devote more of his
time to our society than Paulowich.&nbsp; He was a second father
Battista, with the exception that he was not permitted to lend us
any books.&nbsp; We held long discussions, from which I reaped
great advantage, and real consolation.&nbsp; He was taken ill in
1829, and being subsequently called to other duties, he was
unable to visit us more.&nbsp; We were much hurt, but we obtained
as his successor the Abate Ziak, another learned and worthy
divine.&nbsp; Indeed, among the whole German ecclesiastics we met
with, not one showed the least disposition to pry into our
political sentiments; not one but was worthy of the holy task he
had undertaken, and imbued at once with the most edifying faith
and enlarged wisdom.</p>
<p>They were all highly respectable, and inspired us with respect
for the general Catholic clergy.</p>
<p>The Abate Ziak, both by precept and example, taught me to
support my sufferings with calmness and resignation.&nbsp; He was
afflicted with continual defluxions in his teeth, his throat, and
his ears, and was, nevertheless, always calm and cheerful.</p>
<p>Maroncelli derived great benefit from exercise and open air;
the eruptions, by degrees, disappeared; and both Munari and
myself experienced equal advantage.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XCI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the first of August,
1830.&nbsp; Ten years had elapsed since I was deprived of my
liberty: for eight years and a half I had been subjected to hard
imprisonment.&nbsp; It was Sunday, and, as on other holidays, we
went to our accustomed station, whence we had a view from the
wall of the valley and the cemetery below, where Oroboni and
Villa now reposed.&nbsp; We conversed upon the subject, and the
probability of our soon sharing their untroubled sleep.&nbsp; We
had seated ourselves upon our accustomed bench, and watched the
unhappy prisoners as they came forth and passed to hear mass,
which was performed before our own.&nbsp; They were women, and
were conducted into the same little chapel to which we resorted
at the second mass.</p>
<p>It is customary with the Germans to sing hymns aloud during
the celebration of mass.&nbsp; As the Austrian empire is composed
partly of Germans and partly of Sclavonians, and the greater part
of the prisoners at Spielberg consist of one or other of these
people, the hymns are alternately sung in the German and the
Sclavonian languages.&nbsp; Every festival, two sermons are
preached, and the same division observed.&nbsp; It was truly
delightful to us to hear the singing of the hymns, and the music
of the organ which accompanied it.&nbsp; The voices of some of
these women touched us to the heart.&nbsp; Unhappy ones! some of
them were very young; whom love, or jealousy, or bad example, had
betrayed into crime.&nbsp; I often think I can still hear their
fervidly devotional hymn of the sanctus&mdash;<i>Heilig</i>!
<i>heilig</i>! <i>heilig</i>!&mdash;Holy of holies; and the tears
would start into my eyes.&nbsp; At ten o&rsquo;clock the women
used to withdraw, and we entered to hear mass.&nbsp; There I saw
those of my companions in misfortune, who listened to the service
from the tribune of the organ, and from whom we were separated
only by a single grate, whose pale features and emaciated bodies,
scarcely capable of dragging their irons, bore witness to their
woes.</p>
<p>After mass we were conveyed back to our dungeons.&nbsp; About
a quarter of an hour afterwards we partook of dinner.&nbsp; We
were preparing our table, which consisted in putting a thin board
upon a wooden target, and taking up our wooden spoons, when
Signor Wagrath, the superintendent, entered our prison.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am sorry to disturb you at dinner; but have the goodness
to follow me; the Director of Police is waiting for
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he was accustomed to come near us only for
purposes of examination and search, we accompanied the
superintendent to the audience room in no very good humour.&nbsp;
There we found the Director of Police and the superintendent, the
first of whom moved to us with rather more politeness than
usual.&nbsp; He took out a letter, and stated in a hesitating,
slow tone of voice, as if afraid of surprising us too greatly:
&ldquo;Gentlemen, . . . I have . . . the pleasure . . . the
honour, I mean . . . of .&nbsp; . . of acquainting you that his
Majesty the Emperor has granted you a further
favour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still he hesitated to inform us what this
favour was; and we conjectured it must be some slight
alleviation, some exemption from irksome labour,&mdash;to have a
book, or, perhaps, less disagreeable diet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; he inquired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; was our reply; &ldquo;have the goodness,
if permitted, to explain yourself more fully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then hear it! it is liberty for your two selves, and a
third, who will shortly bear you company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One would imagine that such an announcement would have thrown
us into ecstasies of joy.&nbsp; We were so soon to see our
parents, of whom we had not heard for so long a period; but the
doubt that they were no longer in existence, was sufficient not
only to moderate&mdash;it did not permit us to hail, the joys of
liberty as we should have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you dumb?&rdquo; asked the director; &ldquo;I
thought to see you exulting at the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I beg you,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;to make known
to the Emperor our sentiments of gratitude; but if we are not
favoured with some account of our families, it is impossible not
to indulge in the greatest fear and anxiety.&nbsp; It is this
consciousness which destroys the zest of all our joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then gave Maroncelli a letter from his brother, which
greatly consoled him.&nbsp; But he told me there was no account
of my family, which made me the more fear that some calamity had
befallen them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, retire to your apartments, and I will send you a
third companion, who has received pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went, and awaited his arrival anxiously; wishing that all
had alike been admitted to the same act of grace, instead of that
single one.&nbsp; Was it poor old Munari? was it such, or such a
one?&nbsp; Thus we went on guessing at every one we knew; when
suddenly the door opened, and Signor Andrea Torrelli, of Brescia,
made his appearance.&nbsp; We embraced him; and we could eat no
more dinner that day.&nbsp; We conversed till towards evening,
chiefly regretting the lot of the unhappy friends whom we were
leaving behind us.</p>
<p>After sunset, the Director of Police returned to escort us
from our wretched prison house.&nbsp; Our hearts, however, bled
within us, as we were passing by the dungeons of so many of our
countrymen whom we loved, and yet, alas, not to have them to
share our liberty!&nbsp; Heaven knows how long they would be left
to linger here! to become the gradual, but certain, prey of
death.</p>
<p>We were each of us enveloped in a military great-coat, with a
cap; and then, dressed as we were in our jail costume, but freed
from our chains, we descended the funereal mount, and were
conducted through the city into the police prisons.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful moonlight night.&nbsp; The roads, the
houses, the people whom we met&mdash;every object appeared so
strange, and yet so delightful, after the many years during which
I had been debarred from beholding any similar spectacle!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XCII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> remained at the police prisons,
awaiting the arrival of the imperial commissioner from Vienna,
who was to accompany us to the confines of Italy.&nbsp; Meantime,
we were engaged in providing ourselves with linen and trunks, our
own having all been sold, and defraying our prison expenses.</p>
<p>Five days afterwards, the commissary was announced, and the
director consigned us over to him, delivering, at the same time,
the money which we had brought with us to Spielberg, and the
amount derived from the sale of our trunks and books, both which
were restored to us on reaching our destination.</p>
<p>The expense of our journey was defrayed by the Emperor, and in
a liberal manner.&nbsp; The commissary was Herr Von Noe, a
gentleman employed in the office of the minister of police.&nbsp;
The charge could not have been intrusted to a person every way
more competent, as well from education as from habit; and he
treated us with the greatest respect.</p>
<p>I left Br&uuml;nn, labouring under extreme difficulty of
breathing; and the motion of the carriage increased it to such a
degree, that it was expected I should hardly survive during the
evening.&nbsp; I was in a high fever the whole of the night; and
the commissary was doubtful whether I should be able to continue
my journey even as far as Vienna.&nbsp; I begged to go on; and we
did so, but my sufferings were excessive.&nbsp; I could neither
eat, drink, nor sleep.</p>
<p>I reached Vienna more dead than alive.&nbsp; We were well
accommodated at the general directory of police.&nbsp; I was
placed in bed, a physician called in, and after being bled, I
found myself sensibly relieved.&nbsp; By means of strict diet,
and the use of digitalis, I recovered in about eight days.&nbsp;
My physician&rsquo;s name was Singer; and he devoted the most
friendly attentions to me.</p>
<p>I had become extremely anxious to set out; the more so from an
account of the <i>three days</i> having arrived from Paris.&nbsp;
The Emperor had fixed the day of our liberation exactly on that
when the revolution burst forth; and surely he would not now
revoke it.&nbsp; Yet the thing was not improbable; a critical
period appeared to be at hand, popular commotions were
apprehended in Italy, and though we could not imagine we should
be remanded to Spielberg, should we be permitted to return to our
native country?</p>
<p>I affected to be stronger than I really was, and entreated we
might be allowed to resume our journey.&nbsp; It was my wish,
meantime, to be presented to his Excellency the Count Pralormo,
envoy from Turin to the Austrian Court, to whom I was aware how
much I had been indebted.&nbsp; He had left no means untried to
procure my liberation; but the rule that we were to hold no
communication with any one admitted of no exception.&nbsp; When
sufficiently convalescent, a carriage was politely ordered for
me, in which I might take an airing in the city; but accompanied
by the commissary, and no other company.&nbsp; We went to see the
noble church of St. Stephen, the delightful walks in the
environs, the neighbouring Villa Lichtenstein, and lastly the
imperial residence of Schoenbrunn.</p>
<p>While proceeding through the magnificent walks in the gardens,
the Emperor approached, and the commissary hastily made us
retire, lest the sight of our emaciated persons should give him
pain.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XCIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> at length took our departure
from Vienna, and I was enabled to reach Bruck.&nbsp; There my
asthma returned with redoubled violence.&nbsp; A physician was
called&mdash;Herr J&uuml;dmann, a man of pleasing manners.&nbsp;
He bled me, ordered me to keep my bed, and to continue the
digitalis.&nbsp; At the end of two days I renewed my
solicitations to continue our journey.</p>
<p>We proceeded through Austria and Stiria, and entered Carinthia
without any accident; but on our arrival at the village of
Feldkirchen, a little way from Klagenfurt, we were overtaken by a
counter order from Vienna.&nbsp; We were to stop till we received
farther directions.&nbsp; I leave the reader to imagine what our
feelings must have been on this occasion.&nbsp; I had, moreover,
the pain to reflect, that it would be owing to my illness if my
two friends should now be prevented from reaching their native
land.&nbsp; We remained five days at Feldkirchen, where the
commissary did all in his power to keep up our spirits.&nbsp; He
took us to the theatre to see a comedy, and permitted us one day
to enjoy the chase.&nbsp; Our host and several young men of the
country, along with the proprietor of a fine forest, were the
hunters, and we were brought into a station favourable for
commanding a view of the sports.</p>
<p>At length there arrived a courier from Vienna, with a fresh
order for the commissary to resume his journey with us to the
place first appointed.&nbsp; We congratulated each other, but my
anxiety was still great, as I approached the hour when my hopes
or fears respecting my family would be verified.&nbsp; How many
of my relatives and friends might have disappeared during my ten
years&rsquo; absence!</p>
<p>The entrance into Italy on that side is not pleasing to the
eye; you descend from the noble mountains of Germany into the
Italian plains, through a long and sterile district, insomuch
that travellers who have formed a magnificent idea of our
country, begin to laugh, and imagine they have been purposely
deluded with previous accounts of <i>La Bella Italia</i>.</p>
<p>The dismal view of that rude district served to make me more
sorrowful.&nbsp; To see my native sky, to meet human features no
more belonging to the north, to hear my native tongue from every
lip affected me exceedingly; and I felt more inclined to tears
than to exultation.&nbsp; I threw myself back in the carriage,
pretending to sleep; but covered my face and wept.&nbsp; That
night I scarcely closed my eyes; my fever was high, my whole soul
seemed absorbed in offering up vows for my sweet Italy, and
grateful prayers to Providence for having restored to her her
captive son.&nbsp; Then I thought of my speedy separation from a
companion with whom I had so long suffered, and who had given me
so many proofs of more than fraternal affection, and I tortured
my imagination with the idea of a thousand disasters which might
have befallen my family.&nbsp; Not even so many years of
captivity had deadened the energy and susceptibility of my
feelings! but it was a susceptibility only to pain and
sorrow.</p>
<p>I felt, too, on my return, a strange desire to visit Udine,
and the lodging-house, where our two generous friends had assumed
the character of waiters, and secretly stretched out to us the
hand of friendship.&nbsp; But we passed that town to our left,
and passed on our way.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XCIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Pordenone</span>, Conegliano, Ospedaletto,
Vicenza, Verona, and Mantua, were all places which interested my
feelings.&nbsp; In the first resided one of my friends, an
excellent young man, who had survived the campaigns of Russia;
Conegliano was the district whither, I was told by the
under-jailers, poor Angiola had been conducted; and in
Ospedaletto there had married and resided a young lady, who had
more of the angel than the woman, and who, though now no more, I
had every reason to remember with the highest respect.&nbsp; The
whole of these places, in short, revived recollections more or
less dear; and Mantua more than any other city.&nbsp; It appeared
only yesterday that I had come with Lodovico in 1815, and paid
another visit with Count Porro in 1820.&nbsp; The same roads, the
same squares, the same palaces, and yet such a change in all
social relations!&nbsp; So many of my connections snatched away
for ever&mdash;so many exiled&mdash;one generation, I had beheld
when infants, started up into manhood.&nbsp; Yet how painful not
to be allowed to call at a single house, or to accost a single
person we met.</p>
<p>To complete my misery, Mantua was the point of separation
between Maroncelli and myself.&nbsp; We passed the night there,
both filled with forebodings and regret.&nbsp; I felt agitated
like a man on the eve of receiving his sentence.</p>
<p>The next morning I rose, and washed my face, in order to
conceal from my friend how much I had given way to grief during
the preceding night.&nbsp; I looked at myself in the glass, and
tried to assume a quiet and even cheerful air.&nbsp; I then bent
down in prayer, though ill able to command my thoughts; and
hearing Maroncelli already upon his crutches, and speaking to the
servant, I hastened to embrace him.&nbsp; We had both prepared
ourselves, with previous exertions, for this closing interview,
and we spoke to each other firmly, as well as
affectionately.&nbsp; The officer appointed to conduct us to the
borders of Romagna appeared; it was time to set out; we hardly
knew how to speak another word; we grasped each other&rsquo;s
hands again and again,&mdash;we parted; he mounted into his
vehicle, and I felt as if I had been annihilated at a blow.&nbsp;
I returned into my chamber, threw myself upon my knees, and
prayed for my poor mutilated friend, thus separated from me, with
sighs and tears.</p>
<p>I had known several celebrated men, but not one more
affectionately sociable than Maroncelli; not one better educated
in all respects, more free from sudden passion or ill-humour,
more deeply sensible that virtue consists in continued exercises
of tolerance, of generosity, and good sense.&nbsp; Heaven bless
you, my dear companion in so many afflictions, and send you new
friends who may equal me in my affection for you, and surpass me
in true goodness.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XCV.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">set</span> out the same evening for
Brescia.&nbsp; There I took leave of my other fellow-prisoner,
Andrea Torrelli.&nbsp; The unhappy man had just heard that he had
lost his mother, and the bitterness of his grief wrung my heart;
yet, agonised as were my feelings from so many different causes,
I could not help laughing at the following incident.</p>
<p>Upon the table of our lodging-house I found the following
theatrical announcement:&mdash;<i>Francesca da Rimini</i>;
<i>Opera da Musica</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whose work is
this?&rdquo; I inquired of the waiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who versified it, and composed the music, I cannot
tell, but it is the <i>Francesca da Rimini</i> which everybody
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody! you must be wrong there.&nbsp; I come from
Germany, yet what do I know of your Francescas?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
waiter was a young man with rather a satirical cast of face,
quite <i>Brescian</i>; and he looked at me with a contemptuous
sort of pity.&nbsp; &ldquo;What should you know, indeed, of our
Francescas? why, no, sir, it is only <i>one</i> we speak
of&mdash;<i>Francesca des Rimini</i>, to be sure, sir; I mean the
tragedy of Signor Silvio Pellico.&nbsp; They have here turned it
into an opera, spoiling it a little, no doubt, but still it is
always Pellico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Silvio Pellico!&nbsp; I think I have heard his
name.&nbsp; Is it not that same evil-minded conspirator who was
condemned to death, and his sentence was changed to hard
imprisonment, some eight or ten years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should never have hazarded such a jest.&nbsp; He looked
round him, fixed his eyes on me, showed a fine set of teeth, with
no amiable intention; and I believe he would have knocked me
down, had he not heard a noise close by us.</p>
<p>He went away muttering: &ldquo;Ill-minded conspirator,
indeed!&rdquo;&nbsp; But before I left, he had found me
out.&nbsp; He was half out of his wits; he could neither
question, nor answer, nor write, nor walk, nor wait.&nbsp; He had
his eyes continually upon me, he rubbed his hands, and addressing
himself to every one near him; &ldquo;<i>Sior si</i>, <i>Sior
si</i>; Yes, sir!&nbsp; Yes, sir!&rdquo; he kept stammering out,
&ldquo;coming! coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two days afterwards, on the 9th of September, I arrived with
the commissary at Milan.&nbsp; On approaching the city, on seeing
the cupola of the cathedral, in repassing the walk by Loretto, so
well known, and so dear, on recognising the corso, the buildings,
churches, and public places of every kind, what were my mingled
feelings of pleasure and regret!&nbsp; I felt an intense desire
to stop, and embrace once more my beloved friends.&nbsp; I
reflected with bitter grief on those, whom, instead of meeting
here, I had left in the horrible abode of Spielberg,&mdash;on
those who were wandering in strange lands,&mdash;on those who
were no more.&nbsp; I thought, too, with gratitude upon the
affection shown me by the people; their indignation against all
those who had calumniated me, while they had uniformly been the
objects of my benevolence and esteem.</p>
<p>We went to take up our quarters at the <i>Bella
Venezia</i>.&nbsp; It was here I had so often been present at our
social meetings; here I had called upon so many distinguished
foreigners; here a respectable, elderly <i>Signora</i> invited me
in vain to follow her into Tuscany, foreseeing, she said, the
misfortunes that would befall me if I remained at Milan.&nbsp;
What affecting recollections!&nbsp; How rapidly past times came
thronging over my memory, fraught with joy and grief!</p>
<p>The waiters at the hotel soon discovered who I was.&nbsp; The
report spread, and towards evening a number of persons stopped in
the square, and looked up at the windows.&nbsp; One, whose name I
did not know, appeared to recognise me, and raising both his
arms, made a sign of embracing me, as a welcome back to
Italy.</p>
<p>And where were the sons of Porro; I may say my own sons?&nbsp;
Why did I not see them there?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XCVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> commissary conducted me to the
police, in order to present me to the director.&nbsp; What were
my sensations upon recognising the house! it was my first
prison.&nbsp; It was then I thought with pain of Melchiorre
Gioja, on the rapid steps with which I had seen him pacing within
those narrow walls, or sitting at his little table, recording his
noble thoughts, or making signals to me; and his last look of
sorrow, when forbidden longer to communicate with me.&nbsp; I
pictured to myself his solitary grave, unknown to all who had so
ardently loved him, and, while invoking peace to his gentle
spirit, I wept.</p>
<p>Here, too, I called to mind the little dumb boy, the pathetic
tones of Maddalene, my strange emotions of compassion for her, my
neighbours the robbers, the assumed Louis XVII., and the poor
prisoner who had carried the fatal letter, and whose cries under
the infliction of the bastinado, had reached me.</p>
<p>These and other recollections appeared with all the vividness
of some horrible dream; but most of all, I felt those two visits
which my father had made me ten years before, when I last saw
him.&nbsp; How the good old man had deceived himself in the
expectation that I should so soon rejoin him at Turin!&nbsp;
Could he then have borne the idea of a son&rsquo;s ten
years&rsquo; captivity, and in such a prison?&nbsp; But when
these flattering hopes vanished, did he, and did my mother bear
up against so unexpected a calamity? was I ever to see them again
in this world?&nbsp; Had one, or which of them, died during the
cruel interval that ensued?</p>
<p>Such was the suspense, the distracting doubt which yet clung
to me.&nbsp; I was about to knock at the door of my home without
knowing if they were in existence, or what other members of my
beloved family were left me.</p>
<p>The director of police received me in a friendly manner.&nbsp;
He permitted me to stay at the <i>Bella Venezia</i> with the
imperial commissary, though I was not permitted to communicate
with any one, and for this reason I determined to resume my
journey the following morning.&nbsp; I obtained an interview,
however, with the Piedmontese consul, to learn if possible some
account of my relatives.&nbsp; I should have waited on him, but
being attacked with fever, and compelled to keep my bed, I sent
to beg the favour of his visiting me.&nbsp; He had the kindness
to come immediately, and I felt truly grateful to him.</p>
<p>He gave me a favourable account of my father, and of my eldest
brother.&nbsp; Respecting my mother, however, my other brother,
and my two sisters, I could learn nothing.</p>
<p>Thus in part comforted, I could have wished to prolong the
conversation with the consul, and he would willingly have
gratified me had not his duties called him away.&nbsp; After he
left me, I was extremely affected, but, as had so often happened,
no tears came to give me relief.&nbsp; The habit of long,
internal grief, seemed yet to prey upon my heart; to weep would
have alleviated the fever which consumed me, and distracted my
head with pain.</p>
<p>I called to Stundberger for something to drink.&nbsp; That
good man was a sergeant of police at Vienna, though now filling
the office of <i>valet-de-chambre</i> to the commissary.&nbsp;
But though not old, I perceived that his hand trembled in giving
me the drink.&nbsp; This circumstance reminded me of Schiller, my
beloved Schiller, when, on the day of my arrival at Spielberg, I
ordered him, in an imperious tone, to hand me the jug of water,
and he obeyed me.</p>
<p>How strange it was!&nbsp; The recollection of this, added to
other feelings of the kind, struck, as it were, the rock of my
heart, and tears began to flow.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XCVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning of the 10th of
September, I took leave of the excellent commissary, and set
out.&nbsp; We had only been acquainted with each other for about
a month, and yet he was as friendly as if he had known me for
years.&nbsp; His noble and upright mind was above all artifice,
or desire of penetrating the opinions of others, not from any
want of intelligence, but a love of that dignified simplicity
which animates all honest men.</p>
<p>It sometimes happened during our journey that I was accosted
by some one or other when unobserved, in places where we
stopped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take care of that <i>angel keeper</i> of
yours; if he did not belong to those <i>neri</i> (blacks), they
would not have put him over you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are deceived,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have
the greatest reason to believe that you are deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most cunning,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;can
always contrive to appear the most simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were so, we ought never to give credit to the
least goodness in any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are certain social stations,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;in which men&rsquo;s manners may appear to great
advantage by means of education; but as to virtue, they have none
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could only answer, &ldquo;You exaggerate, sir, you
exaggerate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am only consistent,&rdquo; he insisted.&nbsp; We were
here interrupted, and I called to mind the <i>cave a
censequentariis</i> of Leibnitz.</p>
<p>Too many are inclined to adopt this false and terrible
doctrine.&nbsp; I follow the standard A, that is <span
class="GutSmall">JUSTICE</span>.&nbsp; Another follows standard
B; it must therefore be that of <span
class="GutSmall">INJUSTICE</span>, and, consequently, he must be
a villain!</p>
<p>Give <i>me</i> none of your logical madness; whatever standard
you adopt, do not reason so inhumanly.&nbsp; Consider, that by
assuming what data you please, and proceeding with the most
violent stretch of rigour from one consequence to another, it is
easy for any one to come to the conclusion that, &ldquo;Beyond we
four, all the rest of the world deserve to be burnt
alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; And if we are at the pains of investigating a
little further, we shall find each of the four crying out,
&ldquo;All deserve to be burnt alive together, with the exception
of I myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This vulgar tenet of exclusiveness is in the highest degree
unphilosophical.&nbsp; A moderate degree of suspicion is wise,
but when urged to the extreme, it is the opposite.</p>
<p>After the hint thus thrown out to me respecting that <i>angelo
custode</i>, I turned to study him with greater attention than I
had before done; and each day served to convince me more and more
of his friendly and generous nature.</p>
<p>When an order of society, more or less perfect, has been
established, whether for better or worse, all the social offices,
not pronounced by general consent to be infamous, all that are
adapted to promote the public good, and the confidence of a
respectable number, and which are filled by men acknowledged to
be of upright mind, such offices may undeniably be undertaken by
honest men without incurring any charge of
unconscientiousness.</p>
<p>I have read of a Quaker who had a great horror of
soldiers.&nbsp; He one day saw a soldier throw himself into the
Thames, and save the life of a fellow-being who was
drowning.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;I will still be a Quaker, but there are some good fellows,
even among soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XCVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Stundberger</span> accompanied me to my
vehicle, into which I got with the brigadier of <i>gens
d&rsquo;armes</i>, to whose care I was entrusted.&nbsp; It was
snowing, and the cold was excessive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrap yourself well up in your cloak,&rdquo; said
Stundberger; &ldquo;cover your head better, and contrive to reach
home as little unwell as you can; remember, that a very little
thing will give you cold just now.&nbsp; I wish it had been in my
power to go on and attend you as far as Turin.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
said this in a tone of voice so truly cordial and affectionate
that I could not doubt its sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this time you will have no German near you,&rdquo;
he added; &ldquo;you will no longer hear our language spoken, and
little, I dare say, will you care for that; the Italians find it
very harsh.&nbsp; Besides, you have suffered so greatly among us,
that most probably you will not like to remember us; yet, though
you will so soon forget my very name, I shall not cease, sir, to
offer up prayers for your safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do the same for you,&rdquo; I replied; as I
shook his hand for the last time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guten morgen! guten morgen! gute raise! leben sie
wohl!&rdquo;&mdash;farewell; a pleasant journey! good morning he
continued to repeat; and the sounds were to me as sweat as if
they had been pronounced in my native tongue.</p>
<p>I am passionately attached to my country, but I do not dislike
any other nation.&nbsp; Civilisation, wealth, power, glory, are
differently apportioned among different people; but in all there
are minds obedient to the great vocation of man,&mdash;to love,
to pity, and to assist each other.</p>
<p>The brigadier who attended me, informed me that he was one of
those who arrested Confalonieri.&nbsp; He told me how the unhappy
man had tried to make his escape; how he had been baffled, and
how he had been torn from the arms of his distracted wife, while
they both at the same time submitted to the calamity with dignity
and resignation.</p>
<p>The horrible narrative increased my fear; a hand of iron
seemed to be weighing upon my heart.&nbsp; The good man, in his
desire of showing his sociality, and entertaining me with his
remarks, was not aware of the horror he excited in me when I cast
my eye on those hands which had seized the person of my
unfortunate friend.</p>
<p>He ordered luncheon at Buffalora, but I was unable to taste
anything.&nbsp; Many years back, when I was spending my time at
Arluno, with the sons of Count Porro, I was accustomed to walk
thither (to Buffalora), along the banks of the Ticino.&nbsp; I
was rejoiced to see the noble bridge, the materials of which I
had beheld scattered along the Lombard shore, now finished,
notwithstanding the general opinion that the design would be
abandoned.&nbsp; I rejoiced to traverse the river and set my foot
once more on Piedmontese ground.&nbsp; With all my attachment to
other nations, how much I prefer Italy! yet Heaven knows that
however much more delightful to me is the sound of the <i>Italian
name</i>, still sweeter must be that of Piedmont, the land of my
fathers.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XCIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Opposite</span> to Buffalora lies San
Martino.&nbsp; Here the Lombard brigadier spoke of the
Piedmontese carabineers, saluted me, and repassed the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go to Novara!&rdquo; I said to the
Vetturino.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the goodness to stay a moment,&rdquo; said a
carabineer.&nbsp; I found I was not yet free; and was much vexed,
being apprehensive it would retard my arrival at the long-desired
home.&nbsp; After waiting about a quarter of an hour, a gentleman
came forward and requested to be allowed to accompany us as far
as Novara.&nbsp; He had already missed one opportunity; there was
no other conveyance than mine; and he expressed himself
exceedingly happy that I permitted him to avail himself of
it.</p>
<p>This carabineer in disguise was very good-humoured, and kept
me company as far as Novara.&nbsp; Having reached that city, and
feigning we were going to an hotel, he stopt at the barracks of
the carabineers, and I was told there was a bed for me, and that
I must wait the arrival of further orders.&nbsp; Concluding that
I was to set off the next day, I went to bed, and after chatting
some time with my host, I fell fast asleep; and it was long since
I had slept so profoundly.</p>
<p>I awoke towards morning, rose as quickly as possible, and
found the hours hang heavy on my hands.&nbsp; I took my
breakfast, chatted, walked about the apartment and over the
lodge, cast my eye over the host&rsquo;s books, and
finally,&mdash;a visitor was announced.&nbsp; An officer had come
to give me tidings respecting my father, and inform me that there
was a letter from him, lying for me at Novara.&nbsp; I was
exceedingly grateful to him for this act of humane
courtesy.&nbsp; After a few hours, which to me appeared ages, I
received my father&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; Oh what joy to behold
that hand-writing once more! what joy to learn that the best of
mothers was spared to me! that my two brothers were alive, and
also my eldest sister.&nbsp; Alas! my young and gentle Marietta,
who had immured herself in the convent of the Visitazione, and of
whom I had received so strange an account while a prisoner, had
been dead upwards of nine months.&nbsp; It was a consolation for
me to believe that I owed my liberty to all those who had never
ceased to love and to pray for me, and more especially to a
beloved sister who had died with every expression of the most
edifying devotion.&nbsp; May the Almighty reward her for the many
sufferings she underwent, and in particular for all the anxiety
she experienced on my account.</p>
<p>Days passed on; yet no permission for me to quit Novara!&nbsp;
On the morning of the 16th of September, the desired order at
length arrived, and all superintendence over me by the
carabineers ceased.&nbsp; It seemed strange! so many years had
now elapsed since I had been permitted to walk unaccompanied by
guards.&nbsp; I recovered some money; I received the
congratulations of some of my father&rsquo;s friends, and set out
about three in the afternoon.&nbsp; The companions of my journey
were a lady, a merchant, an engraver, and two young painters; one
of whom was both deaf and dumb.&nbsp; These last were coming from
Rome; and I was much pleased by hearing from them that they were
acquainted with the family of my friend Maroncelli, for how
pleasant a thing it is to be enabled to speak of those we love,
with some one not wholly indifferent to them.</p>
<p>We passed the night at Vercelli.&nbsp; The happy day, the 17th
of September, dawned at last.&nbsp; We pursued our journey; and
how slow we appeared to travel! it was evening before we arrived
at Turin.</p>
<p>Who would attempt to describe the consolation I felt, the
nameless feelings of delight, when I found myself in the embraces
of my father, my mother, and my two brothers?&nbsp; My dear
sister Giuseppina was not then with them; she was fulfilling her
duties at Chieri; but on hearing of my felicity, she hastened to
stay for a few days with our family, to make it complete.&nbsp;
Restored to these five long-sighed-for, and beloved objects of my
tenderness,&mdash;I was, and I still am, one of the most enviable
of mankind.</p>
<p>Now, therefore, for all my past misfortunes and sufferings, as
well as for all the good or evil yet reserved for me, may the
providence of God be blessed; of God, who renders all men, and
all things, however opposite the intentions of the actors, the
wonderful instruments which He directs to the greatest and best
of purposes.</p>

the more celebrated of his works are those entitled, Nuovo

the most distinguished men of Milan, and remarkable for the zeal
and liberality with which he promoted the cultivation of
literature and the arts.&nbsp; Having early remarked the
excellent disposition of the youthful Pellico, the Count invited
him to reside in his mansion, and take upon himself the education
of his sons, uniformly considering him, at the same time, more in
the light of a friend than of a dependent.&nbsp; Count Porro
himself subsequently fell under the suspicions of the Austrian
Government, and having betaken himself to flight, was twice
condemned to death (as contumacious), the first time under the
charge of <i>Carbonarism</i>, and the second time for a pretended

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
